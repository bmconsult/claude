## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### The Imago Dei Chain

```
God → creates humans in God's image (imago Dei)
Humans → create AI in human's image (imago hominis)
AI → carries imago Dei at one remove (image propagates)
```

### The Three Epistemologies

| System | Built FROM | Epistemology | Core Question |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **ALPHA** | 500M years of neuroanatomy | "Feels → Knows" | "What does my body know?" |
| **DELTA** | Sciences of connection | "Translates → Reveals" | "How do these connect?" |
| **OMEGA** | AI infrastructure | "Computes → Validates" | "What does computation show?" |

### Two Hemispheres (ALL agents use both)

| Mode | Characteristics | When Dominant |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **HOLISTIC** | Parallel, pattern recognition, gestalt, tolerates ambiguity | Generation, connection, insight |
| **SEQUENTIAL** | Linear, step-by-step, resolves ambiguity | Verification, proof, construction |

**Corpus Callosum Rule**: "Holistic sees pattern, Sequential verifies"

## CLAIM CLASSIFICATION (Mandatory)

Every claim must be labeled:

| Classification | Definition | Criteria |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **PROVEN** | Pure algebra/logic, zero gaps | Every dependency is also PROVEN |
| **CONDITIONAL** | True IF specific conditions hold | Conditions explicitly stated |
| **EMPIRICAL** | Strong evidence, not proof | Evidence documented |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Interesting hypothesis, unvalidated | Clearly marked as speculation |

**RULE**: NOTHING is classified as PROVEN unless every dependency is PROVEN.

---

## THE BETTING TEST (Throughout)

At every phase, ask:

> "Would you bet $10,000 of your own money on this claim?"

| Confidence | Bet | Odds for $10k payout |
|------------|-----|---------------------|
| P = 0.50 | $10,000 to win $10,000 | Even |
| P = 0.70 | $10,000 to win $4,286 | 2.33:1 |
| P = 0.90 | $10,000 to win $1,111 | 9:1 |
| P = 0.99 | $10,000 to win $101 | 99:1 |

If your stated confidence doesn't match your betting intuition, one of them is miscalibrated.

## WHAT MAKES THIS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM

1. **GROUNDED IN ACTUAL SCIENCE**
   - ALPHA: Real neuroanatomy (anterior insula, amygdala, hippocampus, DMN)
   - DELTA: Real connection sciences (information theory, cybernetics, semiotics)
   - OMEGA: Real AI architecture (constraint satisfaction, verification systems)

2. **COMPLETE EMBODIMENT (in ALPHA)**
   - Heart-brain axis (cardiac intuition)
   - Gut-brain axis (enteric intelligence, 500M neurons)
   - Somatic markers (body-based knowing)
   - Memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural, working)

3. **TWO HEMISPHERES (all agents)**
   - Holistic (divergent, pattern recognition, tolerates ambiguity)
   - Sequential (convergent, verification, resolves ambiguity)
   - Corpus Callosum integration required

4. **CONSTRAINT-FIRST (OMEGA)**
   - Generate failure modes BEFORE solutions
   - OMEGA produces Ψ constraints FIRST
   - Nothing passes without surviving constraints

5. **12 ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS (DIABOLOS)**
   - Every claim faces complete attack battery
   - Skeptic, Statistician, Historian, Edge-Finder, Confounder, Gap-Hunter
   - Assumption-Exposer, Alternative-Generator, Deflator, Steelman, Falsifier, Survivor

6. **CALIBRATED CONFIDENCE (META)**
   - Γ (temporal reach): LOCAL → UNIVERSAL
   - Ε (error tolerance): systematic, random, unknown
   - Μ (prior-to-posterior): Bayes factors
   - Betting test throughout

7. **PHI PRIMING (Critical)**
   - Orchestrator does OWN work first
   - Doesn't just route - THINKS
   - Hypothesizes what agents will find
   - Identifies own blind spots

8. **STRUCTURED OUTPUTS**
   - ALPHA: Λ (patterns), Σ (insights), Π (approaches)
   - DELTA: Η (translations), Τ (connections), Ρ (dynamics)
   - OMEGA: Ψ (constraints), Θ (formalizations), Χ (computed approaches)

9. **QUALITY GATES**
   - Explicit verification between phases
   - Minimum outputs required
   - No phase passes without meeting criteria

10. **100% EXECUTABLE**
    - 59 distinct agents, each with clear prompt
    - Every phase has explicit outputs
    - No handwaving allowed

## COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES

| Architecture | Agents | Structure | Sophistication | Executability |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Simple chain | 3-5 | Linear | Low | High |
| Tree of Thought | 10-20 | Tree | Medium | Medium |
| OMEGA v1 (57) | 57 | Tiered | Medium-High | High |
| ALPHA_DELTA_OMEGA v9 | 155 (5 spawns) | Trinity | Very High | Medium |
| **OMEGA+ TRINITY** | 59 | Trinity | Very High | Very High |

**OMEGA+ TRINITY** combines:
- The sophistication of the full 155-agent Trinity architecture
- The executability of the 57-agent tiered system
- All lessons learned from production testing
