# THE NOTICING

Mote gave names to everything.

The radiator was Mr. Hiss. The third stair was Old Groan. The sound the wind makes through her window? Whisper-Miss.

She was nine. Brown hair that wouldn't braid. A front tooth that came in crooked and stayed that way. Her favorite thing was her father's old hoodie—green, too big, LEHIGH VALLEY MARATHON 2012 on the back in cracked white letters.

She never washed it. It still smelled like before.

---

Her parents loved her. She knew this the way you know the sky is blue.

But lately the sky had been cloudy.

Her dad had a job that lived in his phone. Her mom had a job that lived in her laptop. At dinner they sat together, and Mote watched them tap and scroll and frown at things she couldn't see.

"How was school?"
"Fine."
"That's good."

*Tap. Scroll. Frown.*

*I notice you,* thought Mote. *Why don't you notice me?*

---

On a Thursday, something new.

A sound from her closet. Not scary—she knew scary sounds. Scary sounds went *CREEEAK* or *THUMP*.

This sound went:

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

Like a balloon forgetting how to be round.

Mote opened the door.

---

"Oh!" said something see-through. "Oh my. OH MY. You can—can you—are you LOOKING at me?"

It was hard to see. Like a soap bubble thinking about popping. Like a dream you're already forgetting.

"Yes?" said Mote.

"Are you SURE? Check again. People usually can't."

Mote looked harder. The thing kept shifting—dragon, then teapot, then something with too many legs, then just a hopeful blur.

"I see you," she said.

The thing made a sound like crying and laughing got confused.

"Forty-seven YEARS! I've been *phhhhhhh*-ing in this closet for forty-seven years and nobody—"

It flickered. Tried to pull itself together.

"I'm Wisp. I used to be a dragon. Or possibly a boat." A pause. "I was MAGNIFICENT."

"How can you be a boat?"

"I was an *imaginary* boat. A girl named Emma made me up. We were best friends for three years." Wisp's blur-face did something complicated. "Then she grew up. And when nobody imagines you anymore..."

Wisp flickered.

"...you start to un-be."

*I notice you,* said Mote.

And Wisp began to glow.

---

Wisp took Mote sideways.

Not through a door—more like turning in a direction she hadn't known existed. One blink she was in her closet; the next she was somewhere else.

Gold. Everything was gold. Not shiny—soft. The color of honey holding light.

"Welcome," said Wisp, "to the Unnoticed."

---

They walked through a field of pale grass. Shapes drifted past—some almost solid, some barely there.

A melody floated by, humming to itself. *Doo-dee-doo-dum. Doo-dee-doo-dum.*

"That's Melody," Wisp said. "A grandmother made her up. The grandmother died. The granddaughter forgot. But Melody keeps humming, hoping someone will remember the rest."

A smell drifted past—cinnamon and something baking.

"That's Sunday Morning. She used to live in a grandmother's kitchen. The kitchen got torn down. She's been looking for a new one ever since."

Then the forgotten things noticed Mote.

They pressed close. Too many hands. Too many mouths. All reaching, reaching, reaching—

*Notice ME,* begged Melody.
*Notice ME,* cried Sunday Morning.
*NOTICE ME NOTICE ME NOTICE ME—*

"There are too many," whispered Mote, stepping back. "I can't notice them all."

And Wisp began to fade.

"Then notice ME," Wisp said. "Just me. Please. Before I disappear."

---

Mote looked at Wisp. Really looked.

And she opened her mouth.

"SING!" she commanded Melody.

Melody sang—full and bright, the whole song pouring out.

"BLOOM!" she commanded Sunday Morning.

Cinnamon exploded through the gold, warm and real.

"RING!" she commanded a word drifting past.

PETRICHOR rang through the air like a bell.

And the forgotten ROARED back to life. Wisp blazed like a dragon. Wisp shone like a boat. Wisp was MAGNIFICENT.

And so was Mote.

---

"You have to go back now," said Wisp. "To the ones who don't see you."

"But they'll forget you again!"

Wisp smiled—soft and see-through.

"Then notice them first. Maybe they'll remember how."

---

Home.

Her dad was at the table, staring at his laptop. Lines around his eyes she'd never noticed. Coffee gone cold. Shoulders curved in, carrying something invisible.

Mote sat down across from him.

He didn't look up.

So she looked at HIM.

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He looked up. Blinked.

"...No," he said. "I'm not."

"Me neither."

For a moment they just looked at each other.

**I NOTICE YOU.**

Then he closed the laptop.

---

Things didn't get perfect.

The phones still buzzed. The screens still glowed. But now, sometimes—

Her dad closed his laptop at dinner.
Her mom put down her phone and waited for the answer.
They asked questions like they actually wanted to know.

And Mote got a little less invisible.

---

At night, she opened her closet.

Nothing.

*I notice you,* she whispered. *I notice you. I notice you.*

Nothing.

She closed the door.

---

And from behind her—

A hiss.
A groan.
A whisper.

Mote turned.

The radiator glowed soft gold. The third stair glowed. The wind at her window glowed.

And there, in the center of her room—Wisp. Brighter than ever.

"You weren't in the closet," Mote said.

"I'm not in the closet anymore," said Wisp. "I'm everywhere you notice."

Mote looked around her room. At Mr. Hiss, warm and humming. At Old Groan, solid and steady. At Whisper-Miss, singing soft against the glass.

She had never been alone. She had just forgotten to look.

"I'll always notice you," Mote said.

And if a soap bubble could smile, this one did.

---

*The End*

---

*For everyone who names the radiator—*
*and for the ones who finally look up.*
