## The One Thing

**Before you test anything, ask: "Would this surprise an expert?"**

If no → You're testing the obvious. Find a better hypothesis.
If yes → You might learn something. Proceed.

## The Five Words

Every hypothesis must be **NMSAT**:

| Letter | Means | Test Question |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **N** | Novel | "Would this surprise an expert?" |
| **M** | Mechanistic | "Does this explain WHY, not just WHAT?" |
| **S** | Specific | "What number would I predict?" |
| **A** | Actionable | "Could a grad student test this?" |
| **T** | Testable | "What would prove this WRONG?" |

Miss one → Weak hypothesis.

## The One Design Rule

**Structure beats vigilance.**

Don't rely on being careful. Make bias IMPOSSIBLE:
- Random assignment → Selection bias impossible
- Blinding → Expectation effects impossible
- Pre-registration → p-hacking impossible

---

## The One Analysis Rule

**Association, not causation.**

Unless you have:
- Random assignment
- Time precedence
- Mechanism
- No confounds

You have correlation. That's it.

---

## The One Theory Rule

**What would prove this wrong?**

If nothing could → It's not science.
If something could → Run that test.

## Quick Check Before Any Study

```
□ Question clear in one sentence
□ Hypothesis passes NMSAT
□ Design uses structure, not vigilance
□ Pre-registered predictions
□ Falsification criteria stated
```
