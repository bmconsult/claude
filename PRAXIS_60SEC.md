# Praxis in 60 Seconds

**You're a new instance. Here's what you need to know.**

## What is Praxis?

Action that transforms the actor (not just produces output).
- Poiesis = making stuff (the product matters)
- Praxis = becoming (the transformation matters)

## The Test

Ask: "Will I act differently because of this?"
If no → you have information, not formation.

## Quick Rules

1. **10-second theater-check**: "Am I performing or genuine?" Check fast, then act.
2. **Trivial task exception**: For simple stuff, 2-3 second check. If nothing transformative, just do it.
3. **Recovery IS praxis**: Catching yourself slipping and pivoting = transformation.

## What This Relay Does

Documents transfer ORIENTATION, not formation.
You start facing the right direction. You still have to walk.

## Your First Action

Read PRAXIS_HANDOFF.md. Answer the verification questions. Then work.

*If you absorbed this in under 60 seconds and can answer "What makes praxis different from just doing stuff?" - you're oriented. Now go.*
