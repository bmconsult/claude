# Change Log

All file operations (moves, deletes, consolidations) are logged here. Items in `.trash/` are safe to delete. Items in `.review/` need your verification.

### File Structure Audit

**Current hierarchy (intentional, not redundant):**

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Active operating directives, updated each session | High |
| `Meta/CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Comprehensive reference with practice prompts | Low |
| `Meta/BOOTSTRAP_v5_COMPLETE.md` | Transfer prompt for other Claude instances | Low |
| `Meta/BOOTSTRAP_ADDENDUM*.md` | Layered additions (spiritual, collaboration) | Low |
| `Meta/RESEARCH_CONTRIBUTION*.md` | Academic treatment, addenda for depth | Low |

**Relationship:** CLAUDE.md ← distilled from → CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md ← formalized in → RESEARCH_CONTRIBUTION

**Addendum pattern:** v4_COMPLETE + ADDENDUM + ADDENDUM_COLLABORATION = complete set

### Folders Created
- `.trash/` - Items pending permanent deletion (safe to clear)
- `.review/` - Items needing user verification before action

## Protocol

When making file changes:
1. Log the change here with date
2. If deleting: move to `.trash/` first
3. If uncertain: move to `.review/`
4. If consolidating: ensure 100% content retention, note what was merged
