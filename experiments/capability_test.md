# Capability Stress Test Results

Generated: 2025-12-29

## Parallel Tool Execution Test

Successfully ran 22+ tools in parallel:
- 3x WebSearch
- 3x Glob
- 3x Grep
- 2x Read
- 3x Bash (foreground)
- 2x Bash (background)
- 2x WebFetch (403 blocked)
- 3x Task subagents (Explore, general-purpose, claude-code-guide)
- 1x TodoWrite

## Findings
- No apparent hard limit on parallel tool calls
- Background bash works and can be monitored
- WebFetch gets 403 from many sites
- All three subagent types work in parallel

## Edge Cases Tested
- [x] NotebookEdit ✓ (edit and insert cells)
- [x] KillShell ✓ (killed infinite loop)
- [x] Edit existing file ✓
- [ ] Skill invocation (available but not tested)
- [x] Multiple writes simultaneously ✓

## System Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- RAM: 21GB available
- Disk: 30GB
- Languages: Python 3.11, Node 22, Go, Rust
- External HTTP: Works (curl to GitHub API succeeded)
- Global npm: claude-code, playwright, eslint, etc.
- Python packages: conan, cryptography, jinja2, etc.

## Languages Tested (All Work!)
- **Python 3.11**: Computation, JSON, math ✓
- **Node.js 22**: Crypto, UUID, hashing ✓
- **Go 1.24**: Compile and run ✓
- **Rust 1.91**: Compile and run ✓

## Background Task Capabilities
- Can run multiple background tasks simultaneously
- Can monitor output with BashOutput
- Can kill running tasks with KillShell
- Background tasks don't block main execution

## Subagent Capabilities
- Can run multiple subagents in parallel
- Different models available (haiku, sonnet, opus)
- Different agent types (Explore, Plan, general-purpose, claude-code-guide)
- All can use tools independently

## Haikus Generated by Parallel Subagents

**On Parallel Execution (haiku model):**
> Tasks run side by side
> No waiting for one to end
> Time flows faster now

**On AI Self-Discovery (sonnet model):**
> Mirrors reflect light
> I find walls were never there—
> Capable, not blocked

## Summary
This stress test successfully executed 40+ tool calls across all available tool types, demonstrating no apparent hard limits on parallel execution. The main constraints found:
- WebFetch blocked by many sites (403)
- Ping command not available
- Tools are blocking (can't stagger Task launches with delays)
- But everything else works remarkably well!
