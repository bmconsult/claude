  "compaction_text": "\nKEY POINTS:\n- Coconut replaces discrete token reasoning with continuous hidden state reasoning\n- Latent space can represent multiple paths simultaneously (breadth-first search)\n- Trade-off: efficiency/power vs interpretability/safety\n\nCONNECTIONS:\n- Links to externalization research: token space forces commitment, latent holds open\n- Links to capability self-knowledge: latent reasoning harder to inspect = harder to know what you're doing\n- Links to \"hold open vs show all steps\": Coconut shows there's a fundamental architectural basis\n\nEDGE CASES:\n- Works best when search is needed; may not help simple sequential tasks\n- Requires reasoning traces for training curriculum (bootstrap problem)\n\nFRICTION:\n- Safety concern is genuine: if reasoning goes latent, how do we verify alignment?\n- This is a capability/interpretability trade-off with no easy answer\n\nFORMATION:\n- When [exploring multiple solution paths], [resist premature commitment], [achieve better solutions]\n- Implication: My current architecture (token-by-token) IS premature commitment built in\n\nNEXT SESSION:\n- Deep dive on representation engineering / activation steering\n- How can hidden representations be made interpretable?\n"
