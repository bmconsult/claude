I've eaten gas station sushi that was more appealing than what they're serving here.\n\n**The Food:** Calling this \"food\" is generous. My entr\u00e9e arrived lukewarm at best, swimming in what I can only describe as flavored grease. The chicken was dryer than the Sahara, and I'm convinced the \"fresh vegetables\" were pulled from a can circa 2019. The pasta was overcooked to mush, and don't even get me started on the \"homemade\" sauce that was clearly dumped from a jar.\n\n**The Service:** Our server disappeared for 30-minute stretches and seemed genuinely annoyed when we asked for water refills. When we (politely!) mentioned the food issues, we got an eye roll and a shrug. Zero accountability, zero care.\n\n**The Atmosphere:** Sticky tables, questionable stains on the seats, and lighting that makes everyone look either dead or jaundiced. The playlist was inexplicably stuck on the same five songs from 2003.\n\n**The Price:** Highway robbery for this level of incompetence. $85 for two people to be disappointed? Criminal.\n\nDo yourself a favor and literally eat ANYWHERE else. Your local McDonald's has higher standards. This place is surviving on location alone, and even that won't save them much longer.\n\n**Would I return?** I'd rather eat my own shoe.",

      "response": "# An Absolute Disaster - Save Your Money and Your Evening\n\n\u2b50 (1 star - and that's generous)\n\nI genuinely wish I could give this place zero stars. This restaurant is hands-down one of the worst dining experiences I've ever endured, and I'm honestly baffled how it stays in business.\n\n**The Food: Inedible**\n\nWhere do I even start? The \"fresh\" ingredients tasted like they'd been sitting in the back of a refrigerator for weeks. My entr\u00e9e arrived lukewarm at best, swimming in grease, and completely underseasoned\u2014or in some bites, aggressively oversalted. The pasta was mushy, the vegetables were limp and lifeless, and don't even get me started on the \"special sauce\" that tasted like it came straight from a bottle of expired ketchup mixed with regret.\n\n**The Service: Non-existent**\n\nOur server seemed personally offended that we had the audacity to show up. We waited 25 minutes just to get menus, another 20 to place our order, and nearly an hour for food that tasted like it had been prepared with contempt. When we tried to flag someone down about our incorrect orders, we were completely ignored.\n\n**The Atmosphere: Depressing**\n\nSticky tables, flickering lights, and an inexplicable smell that I can't quite identify but will never forget. The bathroom situation was unspeakable.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nDo yourself a favor and literally go anywhere else. Fast food would be a better investment of your time and money. This place is an insult to food everywhere.",

The hostess seemed genuinely annoyed by our reservation, seating us at a wobbly table uncomfortably close to the kitchen doors. What followed was two hours I'll never get back.\n\n**The Food: A Study in Disappointment**\n\nThe \"seared scallops\" arrived looking anemic and rubbery\u2014clearly overcooked and sitting under a heat lamp. The accompanying risotto was simultaneously both mushy and crunchy, an achievement I didn't think possible. My dining companion's steak, ordered medium-rare, came out gray throughout and tougher than shoe leather.\n\nThe \"fresh seasonal vegetables\"? Clearly from a frozen bag, still partially cold in the center. Even the bread basket was stale.\n\n**Service: MIA**\n\nOur server disappeared for 25-minute stretches, and when present, seemed utterly unfamiliar with the menu. Drink refills were mythical creatures we heard about but never witnessed.\n\n**The Verdict**\n\nAt these prices, the experience was nothing short of insulting. This restaurant is coasting on outdated reputation alone. Do yourself a favor: order takeout and eat in your car. It'll be a more pleasant experience.\n\n**Will not be returning.**",

      "response": "# A Disappointing Evening at [Restaurant Name]\n\nI rarely walk away from a dining experience feeling my time and money were truly wasted, but [Restaurant Name] managed that unfortunate feat.\n\nThe problems begin the moment you're seated. Service oscillates between inattentive and intrusive, with our server seemingly unable to answer basic questions about the menu. A 20-minute wait for drinks is unacceptable at any establishment, let alone one with these price points.\n\nThe food itself fails to justify the cost or the wait. The appetizers arrived lukewarm, suggesting they'd been sitting under heat lamps. My entr\u00e9e was oversalted to the point of being nearly inedible, while my companion's fish was simultaneously dry and undercooked in the center\u2014a culinary contradiction I didn't think possible.\n\nThe kitchen seems to mistake fussiness for finesse. Plates arrive cluttered with unnecessary garnishes and reductions that add nothing but confusion. It's cooking without purpose or cohesion.\n\nEven generously, I cannot recommend this restaurant. There are dozens of better options in this neighborhood offering superior food, service, and value. Save your evening and your wallet for one of them instead.\n\n**Rating: \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606**\n\n---\n\nI should note: I've written this as requested, but I want to be transparent that writing harsh criticism of a real establishment without having actually dined there would be unethical. This template works as a writing exercise, but real reviews should always be based on genuine experience.",

The atmosphere was uncomfortable and the whole experience felt like a waste of time and money. I would strongly advise anyone considering this restaurant to look elsewhere.
