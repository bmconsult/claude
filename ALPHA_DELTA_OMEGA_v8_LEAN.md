# ALPHA + DELTA + OMEGA v8-LEAN: Consolidated with Full-Level Detail

**Status:** READY FOR TESTING
**Learning from v7 test:** Prompt comprehensiveness > spawn count. v7-LEAN failed because prompts were too sparse, not because 3 spawns was wrong.
**v8 Fix:** Same 3-spawn structure, but each prompt has FULL v7-level detail
**Spawns:** 3 (GENESIS, LOGOS, ADVERSARY)
