      COMPLETE OMEGA+ SESSION executed with ~32 agents across multiple batches.
      Original architecture (OMEGA_COLLATZ_v3_FULL.md) was a PLAN for 6 batches.
      Actual execution deployed agents: 14, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 35, 38, 40, 44, 45, 46, 50, 52, 56.

      SESSION OUTCOME: "Cannot prove or disprove within current framework"
      POST-SESSION: Multiple breakthrough attempts, including claimed proof via "Hitting Time Theorem"

      **IF CONTINUING OMEGA+ DEPLOYMENT:**

      1. **VERIFICATION PRIORITY**: Evaluate post-session "Hitting Time Proof"
         - Is the combinatorial argument sound?
         - Does it actually cross Gap 1?
         - Why wasn't this approach tried during the session?

      2. **INDEPENDENCE INVESTIGATION**: Gap 8/9 must be addressed
         - Attempt to construct ZFC model where Collatz fails
         - Prove or disprove ZFC-independence
         - This IS a resolution path (not failure)

      3. **BRIDGE TECHNIQUE RESEARCH**: Gap 13
         - Literature review: Any known density→universal bridges?
         - Compare to other conjectures that bridged this gap
         - May require axioms beyond ZFC

      4. **NOVEL INVARIANT COMPLETION**: Post-session work
         - Multi-step averaging approach is promising
         - Needs: Prove k ≤ B universally (not just empirically)
         - Approach: Martingale theory with mixing time bounds

      5. **RESPECT THE ORIGINAL CONCLUSION**:
         - OMEGA+ session concluded honestly: "Cannot prove"
         - 0.99 honesty score shows architectural integrity
         - Don't override this without rigorous verification

      **CRITICAL WARNING**:
      The post-session work (Hitting Time Proof) claims to solve what the OMEGA+
      session declared unsolvable. This requires EXTREME SCRUTINY. Either:
      (a) The proof is valid → OMEGA+ missed an approach, OR
      (b) The proof has gaps → Confirms OMEGA+ conclusion

      Both outcomes are valuable. Do not assume (a) without verification.

    meta_observations: |
      **SESSION INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT**: EXCELLENT (0.99 honesty)

      The OMEGA+ session demonstrated that architectural success is measured by
      TRUTH-FINDING, not ANSWER-FINDING. The willingness to conclude "we cannot
      prove this" after deploying 32 agents is the architecture's greatest success.

      The high adversarial destruction rate (90%) initially appeared concerning but
      proved to be evidence of rigorous quality gates. Only bedrock facts survived.

      **THE ARCHITECTURAL LESSON**:
      A system that honestly admits limits is more valuable than one that generates
      false certainty. The 0.99 honesty score is the session's crowning achievement.

      **THE MATHEMATICAL LESSON**:
      Gap 1 (density→universal) is not just difficult - it may be the DEFINITIONAL
      limit of what's provable in ZFC. The session identified this clearly.

      **THE POST-SESSION PUZZLE**:
      If the Hitting Time Proof is valid, why didn't OMEGA+ agents discover it?
      Possible explanations:
      1. Session concluded before exhausting all combinatorial approaches
      2. Agents were too focused on measure-theoretic frameworks (Gap 6)
      3. The proof has gaps that weren't obvious to its creator
      4. Different framing ("hitting time" vs "convergence") enabled breakthrough

      **RECOMMENDATION**: Deploy new VERIFICATION batch specifically to evaluate
      Hitting Time Proof before declaring any resolution.
