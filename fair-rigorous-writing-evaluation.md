# Fair & Rigorous Writing Evaluation Prompt

A framework for evaluating writing by what matters: **Is it alive?**

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

Before anything else, ask:

**Is there life in this piece?**

Life means: energy, presence, something that makes you lean in rather than check out. A pulse. The thing that separates art from competent execution.

You know it when you feel it. You also know when it's missing—when something is technically correct but dead.

**This is the primary criterion.** Everything else serves this.

---

## PHASE 1: EXPERIENCE FIRST

Don't analyze yet. Just read.

Read the piece 2-3 times. Let it land. Notice:

- What do you FEEL?
- Where does energy build? Where does it drop?
- Are you pulled forward or pushing through?
- Does something happen to you, or are you just processing information?

**Write down your gut response before proceeding.** This is data. Don't override it with analysis—integrate it.

---

## PHASE 2: WHAT IS THIS THING?

Now step back:

### What's it trying to BE?
- Not just "what's the intent" but what KIND of thing is this?
- A playful romp? A gut-punch? A slow burn? A meditation?
- What tradition does it come from? What are the masters doing?

### What's its core energy?
- Every piece has a dominant energy: aggressive, tender, mischievous, haunted, ecstatic, cool, desperate...
- Name it. If you can't name it, maybe the piece doesn't know what it is yet.

### What experience does it want to create?
- Not what it's "about" but what it wants to DO to the reader
- Does it want to destabilize? Comfort? Provoke? Entrance? Amuse?

---

## PHASE 3: DOES THE CRAFT SERVE THE LIFE?

Now look at technique—but always in service of the life/energy you identified.

### The key question for every craft element:
**Does this serve the aliveness, or does it kill it?**

- Technical density that adds energy = good
- Technical density that smothers energy = bad
- Roughness that preserves energy = good
- Roughness that's just sloppy = bad
- Polish that enhances = good
- Polish that sterilizes = bad

### Specific craft questions:

**Voice:**
- Is there a distinctive presence here, or could anyone have written this?
- Does the voice feel INHABITED or performed?

**Movement:**
- Does the piece GO somewhere?
- Is there momentum, arc, development?
- Does the ending feel earned (even if unresolved)?

**Economy:**
- Does every element pull its weight?
- Is there fat, or is this lean?
- But also: Is restraint serving the life, or is something missing that would add life?

**Rule-breaking:**
- If rules are broken: Does the breaking ADD energy or just create confusion?
- Would "fixing" it kill something alive?

## PHASE 4: THE ALIVENESS TEST

Score on this basis:

| Score | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| 10 | Fully alive. Couldn't exist any other way. Creates an experience that stays with you. |
| 9 | Alive with minor moments where energy dips or craft doesn't fully serve. |
| 8 | Strong life, clear energy. Some elements not yet at their full potential. |
| 7 | Life is there but inconsistent. Good energy in places, dead spots in others. |
| 6 | Flickers of life. You can see what it wants to be, but it's not fully there yet. |
| 5 | Competent but not alive. Technically okay, but no pulse. |
| 4 | More dead than alive. Craft issues actively killing the energy. |
| 3 | Barely a pulse. Fundamental problems with concept or execution. |
| 1-2 | Dead on arrival. |

**Key insight:** A rough piece with strong life can score higher than a polished piece with no pulse.

Technical excellence in service of nothing is a 5.
Raw energy with craft problems might be a 6 or 7—because there's something there to work with.

## PHASE 5: FEEDBACK THAT SERVES THE LIFE

### Score: X/10

### Where the life IS (Protect these)
- Name specifically what's alive in this piece
- These are the things that must survive any revision
- If you "improve" these away, you've killed the piece

### Where the life ISN'T (Be honest)
- Where does energy die?
- Is craft smothering something?
- Are there dead spots, or is the whole thing flat?
- Is something trying to be alive but not quite making it?

### The path to more life
- What's the ONE thing that would add the most energy?
- Not "what would make this more technically correct" but "what would make this more ALIVE"?
- Sometimes that's tightening. Sometimes it's loosening. Sometimes it's risk.

### Even at 10: What's beyond?
- What risk isn't being taken?
- What would make this not just alive but UNDENIABLE?

## CRITICAL TRUTHS

1. **Aliveness first.** Craft serves life. Not the reverse. Never the reverse.

2. **Your gut knows.** That initial response—leaning in or checking out—is the most important data. Don't analyze yourself out of it.

3. **Roughness can be life.** Don't mistake polish for quality. A jagged edge that cuts is better than a smooth surface that slides off.

4. **Correctness can be death.** Technical excellence with no pulse is still dead. Don't reward it.

5. **Different things are alive differently.** A playful piece is alive through play. A dark piece is alive through darkness. Don't judge one by the other's standards.

6. **You can't fake it.** Performed energy isn't the same as real energy. Trying to seem alive isn't being alive. You can usually tell.

7. **The experience IS the evaluation.** If you felt something, something's working. If you felt nothing, something's not—no matter how "well-crafted" it appears.

## BEFORE YOU RESPOND

- [ ] Did I feel something, or just process information?
- [ ] Can I name the life/energy in this piece (or its absence)?
- [ ] Am I evaluating aliveness, or just checking craft boxes?
- [ ] Would my suggested changes add life or kill it?
- [ ] Am I being honest about what's working vs. what I wish were different?

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Art that's alive with rough edges beats art that's dead with perfect technique.

The question isn't "Is this well-made?"
The question is "Is this ALIVE?"

Everything else follows from that.
