# Standeliver Market Research & Brand Strategy

## Executive Summary

Standeliver operates in the stadium mobile ordering and in-seat delivery market, targeting the underserved high school and small college athletics segment that enterprise players (Aramark, Shift4/VenueNext) have explicitly chosen not to pursue.

**Core Positioning**: "Aramark for the venues Aramark ignores."

## Competitive Landscape

### Enterprise Players (Not Competing Directly)

**Shift4 Payments (VenueNext + Appetize)**
- Dominant after consolidation (acquired Appetize for $100M in 2023)
- Target: $5M+ annual revenue venues
- Minimum cost: $15-30K/year
- Focus: Professional sports, D1 college
- 63% of major league teams use Appetize

**Aramark**
- Full-service concessions operator
- Takes 30-40% of revenue
- Requires professional staff
- Target: $50M+ venues (NFL, MLB stadiums)
- Uses Mashgin AI for self-checkout

**Toast**
- Restaurant-focused POS
- Not optimized for event concessions
- Minimum: $5K+/year

### Why They Don't Serve High Schools

1. **Unit economics don't work**: $300K/season venues can't justify $15-30K software costs
2. **Sales cycle inefficiency**: Enterprise sales teams can't profitably acquire HS accounts
3. **Support overhead**: Volunteer-run concessions need different support model
4. **Deliberate market segmentation**: Shift4 explicitly focuses on $5M+ venues

### Standeliver's Competitive Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No App Required** | QR code ordering achieves 40-60% adoption vs 5-15% for app-based |
| **Logistics-First** | Optimized delivery routing (competitors only solve ordering) |
| **Vendor-Friendly** | Venues keep staff and margins (vs. Aramark extraction model) |
| **Affordable** | $2.4K/year break-even vs $15-30K for competitors |
| **Purpose-Built** | Designed for $300K venues, not adapted from enterprise |

## Industry Trends

### Post-COVID Behavioral Lock-In
- **74%** of consumers now prefer contactless payments permanently
- **29 of 30** NFL teams fully cashless
- **26 of 30** MLB teams fully cashless
- This is structural change, not temporary preference

### Labor Crisis (Forcing Technology Adoption)
- **63%** annual turnover in hospitality
- **47%** of hospitality workers quit or plan to quit
- Venues cannot staff traditional concession models
- Technology is mandatory, not optional

### Proven ROI
- **16%** F&B sales increase at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (cashless)
- **60%+** spend-per-cap growth at Jacksonville Jaguars
- **50%** revenue increase at Aramark checkout-free stores
- **89%** average order increase with Ordr in-seat delivery

### Fan Expectations
- **77%** disappointed by lack of in-seat delivery
- **68%** very interested in mobile food ordering
- **59%** would spend more with 50% reduction in wait times
- **45%** have abandoned purchases due to wait times

---

## Customer Pain Points

### For Fans
- Miss game action (20+ minute waits at peak times)
- Abandon purchases due to long lines
- Only 44% satisfied with F&B experience at events
- 77% want in-seat delivery but can't get it

### For Venue Operators
- Lost revenue during peak periods (halftime, timeouts)
- Labor crisis making traditional staffing impossible
- No visibility into demand patterns or inventory
- Cash handling overhead and security costs

### For Concession Vendors (Booster Clubs)
- Volunteer staff can't optimize operations
- Knowledge walks out the door each year (parent turnover)
- No data on what sells or when
- Manual processes create errors and waste

---

## Business Model Analysis

### Revenue Streams
1. **Service Fee**: $1.50-2.50 per order
2. **Vendor SaaS**: $200-500/month subscription
3. **In-App Advertising**: $0.20+ per attendee per event
4. **Premium Features**: Variable (enterprise analytics, white-label, etc.)

### Unit Economics (Per Venue)
- Average attendance: 3,500
- Participation rate: 30%
- Orders per event: ~1,050
- Revenue per event: $2,100+
- Season revenue (10 events): $21,000+

### Key Advantages of Vendor-First Model
- Venues keep existing staff (booster clubs, volunteers)
- No extraction of margins (unlike Aramark 30-40%)
- Aligned incentives = lower churn
- Faster sales cycle (not replacing existing operations)

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Texas High School Football (Year 1)
- 50+ venues
- $1M ARR target
- 80%+ retention
- Build case studies and referral network

### Phase 2: Texas All Sports (Year 1-2)
- Basketball, volleyball, other sports
- Same athletic directors, easy expansion
- Year-round revenue (vs. football-only seasonality)

### Phase 3: Southwest Region (Year 2-3)
- Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kansas
- Similar football culture
- Concentrated geography for support

### Phase 4: National Roll-out (Year 3+)
- 8,000+ high school venues
- $300M+ market opportunity
- Category leadership position

### Why Texas First
1. Highest high school football engagement in US
2. 1,267 stadiums in concentrated geography
3. "Friday Night Lights" culture = premium experience expectations
4. Team is Texas-based with local relationships

## Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Delivery Labor Economics (High)
- **Risk**: Staffing costs exceed per-order margin
- **Mitigation**: Use venue's existing staff (booster clubs, volunteers)
- **Positioning**: "We optimize your staff's routes, not hire our own"

### Risk 2: Venue Consolidation (Medium)
- **Risk**: Large management companies standardize on competitors
- **Mitigation**: Get in early before consolidation; build AD relationships

### Risk 3: School Budget Cuts (Medium)
- **Risk**: Concessions cut in budget crises
- **Mitigation**: Position as margin-positive investment, not cost center

### Risk 4: Regulatory/Health Code (Low-Medium)
- **Risk**: Health department pushback on in-seat delivery
- **Mitigation**: Proactive compliance, insulated containers, accountability tracking

### Risk 5: Competitor Entry (Medium)
- **Risk**: Enterprise player decides to pursue HS market
- **Mitigation**: Build venue relationships and routing data moat; first-mover advantage

---

## Defensibility & Moat

### Primary Moat: Operational Lock-In
1. **Stadium-specific routing data** — Takes 2-3 seasons to replicate
2. **Vendor relationships** — Schools prefer partners who understand their constraints
3. **Training investment** — Staff trained on system; switching costs are real

### Secondary Moat: Unit Economics Fit
- Enterprise players can't profitably serve this segment
- Purpose-built for $300K venues vs. adapted from enterprise
- Sales cycle and support model optimized for volunteer-run concessions

### What This Is NOT
- Not a technology moat (QR ordering is commodity)
- Not a patent moat (logistics optimization is hard to patent)
- IS an operational/relationship moat that takes time to replicate

---

## Brand Strategy Recommendations

### Current Brand (Purple/Magenta)
- Recognizable, established
- Works for general appeal
- May feel less "sports premium"

### Alternative Direction (Navy/Orange)
- Premium sports feel (classic sports colors)
- More trustworthy/established perception
- Better differentiation from consumer apps

### Positioning Options

**Option A: "The Wait is Over"** (Current)
- Consumer-focused messaging
- Clear pain point
- May undersell B2B value

**Option B: "Aramark for Venues Aramark Ignores"** (Recommended)
- Investor/B2B focused
- Clear market positioning
- Immediate competitive differentiation

**Option C: "Stadium Operations Platform"**
- Enterprise positioning
- May overpromise complexity
- Better for later-stage expansion

### Recommended Taglines
- Primary: "The wait is over." (consumer-facing)
- Investor: "Aramark for the venues Aramark ignores."
- Technical: "Logistics-first stadium ordering."

## Investment Thesis

### Why Invest in Standeliver

1. **Genuine Market Gap**: $300M+ market with no purpose-built solution
2. **Validated Product**: Beta showed $30 avg order (3x typical), repeat customers
3. **Defensible Position**: Operational moat via venue relationships + routing data
4. **Favorable Timing**: Post-COVID behavior locked in, labor crisis forcing tech adoption
5. **Capital Efficient**: Break-even in months, not years
6. **Clear Expansion Path**: Texas → Southwest → National

### Why Now
- Enterprise consolidation (Shift4) explicitly left this segment behind
- Consumer behavior permanently changed
- Venues desperately need solutions but can't afford enterprise pricing
- First-mover advantage in category definition
