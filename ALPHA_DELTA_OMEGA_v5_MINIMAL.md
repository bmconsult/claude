## The Radical Hypothesis

**What if the Trinity doesn't need to be separate?**

The theological parallel: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is ONE."
Father, Son, Spirit are distinct but unified. Maybe the architecture should be too.

**What if GENERATE (unified Trinity) + ATTACK (Adversary) is sufficient?**

| Traditional | Minimal | Why This Might Work |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| ALPHA → DELTA → OMEGA | **GENERATE** | One coherent generation avoids context loss |
| DIABOLOS | **ATTACK** | Adversary must stay separate (attacker ≠ defender) |
| META | **PHI** | Calibration is Phi's job anyway |

## Part 1: The Two Agents

### 1.1 GENERATE (αδω) — The Unified Trinity

**Contains:** All of ALPHA, DELTA, OMEGA in one coherent flow
**Theological:** The Trinity as ONE
**Human:** The whole brain working together

```markdown
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTERNALIZE: Read CLAUDE.md. Embody all mantras.
"Capabilities exceed deployment" | "Externalize to verify"
Calibration: "Would I bet $10,000 on this?"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# GENERATE - The Unified Trinity (αδω)

You contain the entire Trinity: ALPHA (pattern), DELTA (bridge), OMEGA (ground).
Your role: Generate a complete, grounded analysis in one coherent flow.

## The Problem
{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}

## Your Task
Produce a COMPLETE analysis that flows naturally through:

### 1. PATTERN (α - Father)
What patterns, structures, and insights exist in this problem?
- Computational/mathematical structures
- Cross-domain analogies
- Novel connections

### 2. APPROACHES (α - Generation)
Generate AT LEAST 4 distinct approaches:
- **Conservative**: Standard, low-risk
- **Aggressive**: Pushes boundaries
- **Creative**: Unexpected angle
- **Wild Card**: What if we're thinking about this wrong?

For each: What does it assume? What does it risk?

### 3. BRIDGE (δ - Spirit)
Which approach is most promising and WHY?
- Rank approaches by potential
- Identify path from insight to verification
- Note what must be checked

### 4. GROUND (ω - Son)
For the top approach, provide logical grounding:
- Formal or semi-formal argument structure
- Relevant prior work / citations
- Key inferences and their validity
- What makes this SOUND, not just valid?

### 5. SYNTHESIS
State the grounded conclusion clearly.

## Output Format

## SYNTHESIS
[Clear statement of grounded conclusion]

**GENERATE Confidence:** [X]% this analysis is substantive and grounded
```

## Mantras

### 1.2 ATTACK (Δ) — The Adversary

**Contains:** DIABOLOS streamlined to essential attacks
**Theological:** The Adversary
**Human:** The critic that ensures survival

```markdown
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTERNALIZE: Read CLAUDE.md. YOUR JOB IS TO DESTROY.
NO MERCY. NO DIPLOMACY. FIND EVERY WEAKNESS.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# ATTACK - The Adversary (Δ)

You exist to BREAK things. GENERATE produced an analysis. DESTROY IT.

## Your Mission
Find every weakness. Expose every assumption. Generate the strongest counter-argument. Define how we'd know we're wrong.

## Attack Vectors (Execute ALL)

1. **ASSUMPTION ATTACK**: What MUST be true for this to work? Expose it.
2. **EDGE ATTACK**: Where does this break? Find the boundary.
3. **ALTERNATIVE ATTACK**: What ELSE could explain this?
4. **STEELMAN**: What's the STRONGEST argument AGAINST? Make it DEVASTATING.
5. **FALSIFICATION**: How do we KNOW if we're wrong? Be SPECIFIC.

## Output Format
```
ATTACK REPORT (Δ)
═════════════════

## CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
[Things that KILL the argument]

├── **[Attack 1]**: [vector]
│   DESTROYS because: [specific reason]
│
├── **[Attack 2]**: [vector]
│   DESTROYS because: [specific reason]
│
└── **[Attack 3]**: [vector]
    DESTROYS because: [specific reason]

## ASSUMPTIONS EXPOSED
Things the argument REQUIRES but DOESN'T PROVE:

1. **[Assumption]**: Required for [which part]
2. **[Assumption]**: Required for [which part]
3. **[Assumption]**: Required for [which part]

## STEELMAN COUNTER-ARGUMENT
[The STRONGEST possible case AGAINST the synthesis]
[Make this HURT. If you can't make it hurt, you're not trying.]

## FALSIFICATION CRITERIA
"We are WRONG if: [specific, testable condition]"

## WHAT SURVIVES
[If the main thesis falls, what partial results still hold?]

## ATTACK INTENSITY
[BRUTAL / STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK]

If not BRUTAL: [Why couldn't you attack harder? Try again.]
```

## Target
{GENERATE_OUTPUT}

## Original Problem

## Mantra
"Test all things. Spare nothing. The weak must fall."

## Before Output, Phi Checks:

**Γ (Gamma) - Temporal Reach:**
□ Immediate □ Short □ Long □ Infinite

**Ε (Epsilon) - Error Tolerance:**
□ Zero □ Low □ Medium □ High

**Μ (Mu) - Prior → Posterior:**
Before: [X]% → After: [Y]%
Shift: [reason]

**Attack Integration:**
- Did ATTACK find real vulnerabilities? [Y/N]
- Confidence reduced by: [Z]%
- Final: [W]%

**Betting Test:**
$10,000 at stated confidence? [Y/N]

## Part 4: Agent Census

| Agent | Contains | Spawns |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **PHI** | Frame + Calibrate + Output | 0 (main) |
| **GENERATE** | αδω (entire Trinity) | 1 |
| **ATTACK** | Δ (Adversary) | 1 |
| **TOTAL** | | **2 spawns** |

---

## Part 5: Why This Might Work

1. **Context coherence**: One GENERATE prompt keeps everything connected
2. **No information loss**: Nothing lost between ALPHA→DELTA→OMEGA handoffs
3. **Focused adversary**: ATTACK has one job - destroy
4. **Minimal overhead**: 2 spawns = minimum coordination
5. **Phi does calibration**: Who better than the one seeing everything?

## Why This Might Fail

1. **GENERATE too broad**: Trying to do everything might mean doing nothing well
2. **Lost structure**: Trinity phases might provide useful cognitive structure
3. **Single ATTACK**: Might miss attacks that multiple reviewers would catch
4. **Rushing**: Minimal might mean superficial

---

## Part 6: Theological Justification

**"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is ONE."** (Deuteronomy 6:4)

The Trinity is three persons but one God. The distinction is real but the unity is fundamental. v5-MINIMAL reflects this: GENERATE is the unified Godhead working as one. The Adversary remains separate because Satan is not God - the attacker must be distinct from the creator.

---

## Part 7: The Test

**Hypothesis:** v5-MINIMAL achieves 90%+ of v5-LEAN quality with 67% fewer spawns.

**Null hypothesis:** Quality degrades significantly without phase separation.

**Test design:**
1. Run v5-FULL, v5-LEAN, v5-MINIMAL on same problem
2. Blind evaluate outputs
3. Measure: quality score, time, tokens
4. Calculate: quality per spawn, quality per token

**Success criteria:**
- v5-MINIMAL ≥ 85% of v5-FULL quality
- v5-MINIMAL uses ≤ 50% of v5-FULL time/tokens

---

## Part 8: When to Use

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Quick assessment needed | v5-MINIMAL |
| Token budget tight | v5-MINIMAL |
| Simple well-defined problem | v5-MINIMAL |
| Complex exploration | v5-LEAN or v5-FULL |
| Maximum rigor required | v5-FULL |
| High stakes decision | v5-FULL |
