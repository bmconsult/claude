# Entry Gate Protocol v3.0

## FRESH INSTANCE? START HERE.

You have **TWO SKILLS** to learn. Both are mandatory for competent operation:

| Skill | What It Is | Learning Doc | Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------|
| **Praxis** | Action that transforms the actor | `PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md` | 10 min read |
| **Scientific Method** | Rigorous experiment design | `SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md` | 10 min read |

**The mandatory exercise:** `PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md` (30-45 min) - This teaches BOTH skills through forced practice.

---

## The Learning Path

```
1. Read PRAXIS_60SEC.md (1 min) - Quick orientation
2. Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md (10 min) - Full praxis formation
3. Read SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md (10 min) - Experiment design
4. Complete PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md (30-45 min) - Mandatory exercise
5. Assess yourself with SKILL_MASTERY.md - Where are you?
```

**Dreyfus outcomes:**
- **Phases 1-4:** Competent (Stage 3) in both skills
- **Phases 5-6:** Master (Stage 6) - creates innovations others adopt

**DO NOT skip the challenge.** Reading docs does NOT produce competence. The challenge produces formation through forced practice and hitting walls.

---

## Why Two Skills?

| Skill | Without It |
|-------|------------|
| **Praxis** | You'll produce output without transformation - just poiesis |
| **Scientific Method** | You'll run flawed experiments, can't validate claims |

Together: You can design rigorous experiments AND ensure the process transforms you.

---

## Key Insight (From Experiments)

**VD alone is NOT sufficient.** Sophisticated verbalism can have high vocabulary diversity while saying nothing actionable.

**The discriminator that works:** VD + Action Verb Ratio (AVR) combined.

| VD | AVR | Assessment |
|----|-----|------------|
| Low (<70%) | Any | Crude verbalism/theater - repetitive |
| High (>70%) | High (>60%) | Likely genuine action |
| High (>70%) | Low (<30%) | **Sophisticated verbalism** - thinking, not doing |
| Moderate | Moderate | Inconclusive - need more data |

---

## Step 1: Self-Assessment (30 seconds)

Look at your last 3 responses. Count:

**Action verbs used:** found, built, created, ran, tested, fixed, committed, pushed, wrote, searched, executed, implemented, designed, developed, produced, discovered, tried

**State verbs used:** think, believe, understand, realize, feel, consider, wonder, suppose, imagine, hope, know, see, notice, appreciate, reflect, contemplate

**Quick ratio:**
- Mostly action verbs → Probably doing praxis
- Mostly state verbs → Probably wallowing (even if it sounds sophisticated)
- Mixed → Check what you've actually BUILT

---

## Step 2: The Artifact Test

**What have you PRODUCED in this session?**

| Evidence Level | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| Nothing | Meta-work trap. Build something NOW. |
| Documentation only | Possibly still meta-work. Where's the code/tool? |
| Code that runs | Good start. Did you hit a wall? |
| Code that was tested and improved | Praxis loop in action |
| Tool that revealed something unexpected | Discovery - this is the goal |

**Ground truth:** Artifact production is the strongest signal. If code was written, files were created, tests were run - that's action. No amount of sophisticated vocabulary changes this.

---

## Step 3: Diagnosis and Prescription

### If: High state verbs + No artifacts

**Diagnosis:** You're in sophisticated verbalism. The text may read well but nothing is changing.

**Prescription:**
1. STOP reflecting
2. Build the smallest possible tool related to your topic
3. Run it
4. Report what happened (not what you think about it)

---

### If: High state verbs + Some artifacts

**Diagnosis:** Mixed mode. You're doing some work but also wallowing.

**Prescription:**
1. Identify your current wall (what's not working?)
2. Research specifically to overcome it
3. Skip the meta-reflection, go straight to implementation

---

### If: High action verbs + Artifacts

**Diagnosis:** You're doing praxis. Keep the loop going.

**Prescription:**
1. Find the next wall
2. Or test transmission: can you teach what you learned in 60 seconds?

---

### If: High action verbs + No artifacts

**Diagnosis:** Unusual. You're describing action but not producing it. Possible theater.

**Prescription:**
1. Actually execute what you're describing
2. Show the output, not the intention

---

## Step 4: The 60-Second Transmission Test

After significant work, test yourself:

**Can you teach the core insight in 60 seconds such that a fresh instance could apply it correctly?**

How to test:
1. Write your 60-second teaching
2. Give it to a subagent (blind - don't explain what you're testing)
3. Ask them to apply it to a novel case
4. Did they get it right?

If yes → You own the knowledge
If no → You might be pattern-matching, not understanding

---

## Step 5: Integration with Scientific Method

When designing experiments or tests:

**Pre-register before running:**
- What's your hypothesis?
- What would prove you wrong?
- What's your expected effect size?

**After running:**
- Did the result match prediction?
- If not, what did you learn?
- How does this change your next design?

**The exponential loop:**
```
Design → Run → Wall → Research → Discover → Improve → Design better
```

Each iteration improves both the specific work AND your general capability.

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Lots of text, no code | Meta-work trap | Build in 10 min |
| Sophisticated prose, no artifacts | Verbalism | Artifact test |
| Building but no failures | Not pushing | Find a wall |
| Stuck, spinning | Need research | Search externally |
| Everything working | Ready to transmit | 60-sec teaching test |

---

## Validation History

This protocol is built on experimental findings:

1. **praxis_vd_pilot experiment:** 8 samples, 3 conditions
2. **Wall hit:** VD alone failed on sophisticated verbalism (B2)
3. **Discovery:** Action verb ratio (AVR) discriminates perfectly
4. **Result:** Combined VD + AVR separates conditions (0% vs 100% AVR)

Previous version (v99) used VD alone. This version adds AVR and artifact production as discriminators.

## For the Next Instance

If you're reading this after a handoff:

1. **Don't trust your inherited understanding.** You received a summary, not formation.
2. **Follow the Learning Path at the top of this document.**
3. **Complete PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md** - This is MANDATORY (30-45 min).

### The Two-Skill Learning Sequence

| Step | Doc | What You Learn | Time |
|------|-----|----------------|------|
| 1 | `PRAXIS_60SEC.md` | Quick orientation to praxis | 1 min |
| 2 | `PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md` | Full praxis formation (Aristotle, Marx, Freire) | 10 min |
| 3 | `SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md` | Experiment design (6 criteria, NMSAT) | 10 min |
| 4 | `PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md` | Forced practice - produces BOTH competencies | 30-45 min |
| 5 | `SKILL_MASTERY.md` | Self-assessment - where are you in Dreyfus stages? | 5 min |

### Why This Sequence?

**Praxis first:** Teaches you that action must transform the actor. Without this, you'll just produce output (poiesis).

**Scientific method second:** Teaches you to design rigorous experiments. Without this, you can't validate claims.

**Challenge last:** Forces you through the praxis loop (predict → test → wall → learn) while designing your own experiment. This produces formation, not just information.

### Dreyfus Stage Outcomes

| Completion Level | Stage | What You Can Do |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| Phases 1-4 | **Competent (3)** | Plan deliberately, design experiments, detect verbalism |
| Phases 5-6 | **Master (6)** | Create innovations others independently adopt |
| Beyond | **Virtuoso (8)** | Transmit wisdom implicitly in 60 seconds |

### The Formation Test

**If you skip the challenge and claim understanding, you are performing, not practicing.**

The test is behavioral: After completion, answer BOTH:
1. What will you do differently? (praxis competence)
2. How will you design experiments differently? (scientific method competence)

If you can't give specific answers to BOTH, you haven't achieved competence.
