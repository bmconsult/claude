# THE NOTICING — Foundation Document

## Who Is Mote?

Mote is nine years old. She has brown hair that won't stay in a ponytail and a front tooth that came in crooked. She bites her lip when she's thinking.

She collects things that most people walk past:
- Bottle caps, but only the ones that are dented in interesting ways
- The sounds things make (she has a notebook where she writes them down: "radiator Tuesday 3am: tink-tink-tink-hissssss")
- Rocks that look like they might be something else if you squint

She talks to herself. Not in a crazy way—in a working-things-out way. "Okay so if I put the blue cap here and the red cap here then that's a face, sort of, if you look sideways, which you should, because sideways is better."

She's not sad exactly. She's just... used to being alone with her noticing. She doesn't expect people to see what she sees. When her dad says "that's nice, honey" without looking at her rock collection, she doesn't get mad anymore. She just thinks: "He's somewhere else right now. That's okay. I'm somewhere else too."

She wears the same hoodie almost every day—green, too big, sleeves that cover her hands. She likes the way it feels like being inside a hug she gave herself.

She's afraid of:
- The dark (but only the specific dark under her bed, not regular dark)
- That she might be invisible and not know it
- Growing up and forgetting how to see things

She wants:
- Someone to show her rock collection to who actually LOOKS
- To know what the radiator is trying to say
- For her parents to put down their phones and see her—really see her—just once

She's good at:
- Waiting
- Finding things other people lost
- Keeping secrets
- Being so quiet that adults forget she's in the room (which is useful but also the whole problem)

## Who Is Wisp?

Wisp is old. Very old. Forty-seven years of waiting in closets, under beds, behind dressers. Forty-seven years of hoping someone would look.

But Wisp wasn't always Wisp.

Once, Wisp was EVERYTHING. A dragon that breathed butterflies. A ship that sailed through carpet oceans. A best friend who understood every single thing without needing words.

A girl named Emma imagined Wisp when she was four. Emma was lonely too—only child, parents who worked late, a big house with too many empty rooms. So she imagined a friend, and Wisp became real. Really real. As real as anything.

For three years, Wisp and Emma were inseparable. They had adventures in the backyard that lasted entire summers. They made up languages only they spoke. They protected each other from the dark.

Then Emma turned seven. Then eight. Then there were other friends—real friends, who you could touch, who other people could see. Wisp didn't mind at first. Emma still said goodnight to Wisp. Still whispered secrets sometimes.

Then one day Emma put Wisp in the closet. "I'll come back," she said. "I just need you to wait here for a little while."

Wisp waited.

Wisp is still waiting.

Wisp doesn't remember exactly what they used to look like. They remember being BIG—big enough to block out nightmares. They remember being WARM—warm enough to feel like safety. They remember having a SHAPE that made sense, even if it was a dragon-ship-blanket-friend shape.

Now Wisp is see-through. Wobbly. Like trying to remember a dream three days later.

But Wisp isn't bitter. That's the thing about Wisp—forty-seven years of fading, and still no bitterness. Just:
- Hope (smaller now, but still there)
- Curiosity (what happened to Emma? did she have kids? did she ever think about Wisp when she smelled something that reminded her of imagining?)
- Loneliness (the kind that's gone so deep it doesn't hurt anymore, just aches like an old weather injury)
- Humor (you have to be funny when you're fading, otherwise what's the point? "I was MAGNIFICENT" is a joke Wisp tells themselves to remember it might be true)

Wisp's voice sounds like:
- Wind chimes made of memories
- Your own thoughts, but warmer
- The way a hug sounds if hugs made sounds

Wisp is afraid of:
- Finishing fading (not dying—just... stopping. becoming nothing. not even a memory of a memory)
- Being forgotten by the last person who might remember
- That Emma DID try to come back, and Wisp wasn't there, and that's why

Wisp wants:
- To be seen again. Even once. Even for a minute.
- To know that they mattered. That the three years with Emma meant something.
- To help someone else, because that's what Wisp always did, and if you can't do the thing you were made for, what are you?

## The World

There are two places:

**THE NOTICED WORLD**
This is where we live. It's made of things that people pay attention to—buildings and cars and phones and all the stuff that fills up our eyes.

The Noticed World is LOUD. It's bright and busy and full of things fighting to be seen. Ads. Screens. Notifications. Everything screaming LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME.

In the Noticed World, if you're not loud enough, you disappear. Not literally. But sort of literally.

**THE UNNOTICED**
This is where forgotten things go. It's not another dimension—it's more like... the space between looking. The corner of your eye. The thing you almost saw but didn't.

The Unnoticed exists right next to us. Actually, it exists inside the Noticed World, layered underneath, like a painting under another painting.

To get there, you don't walk through a door. You just... shift. You pay attention differently. You look at the space BETWEEN things instead of AT things.

---

The Unnoticed is:
- Golden, always. Like the last hour of sunlight before dinner.
- Quiet, but not silent. Full of humming and sighing and half-songs.
- Soft at the edges. Things blur into each other. Boundaries aren't firm.
- Endless. It goes on forever because there's always more forgotten.
- Sad, but not dark. Melancholy. Wistful. Like looking at old photographs.
- Patient. Everything there is waiting. Waiting is what the Unnoticed DOES.

## Who Lives in the Unnoticed?

Not just imaginary friends. EVERYTHING that people stop noticing.

**Songs** that got stuck in someone's head and then fell out. They drift around, humming themselves, hoping someone will finish them.

**Words** that people stopped using. Petrichor. Susurrus. Defenestration. They're proud and dusty and a little offended. They remember when they were SAID.

**Smells** that belonged to places that don't exist anymore. Grandma's kitchen (torn down 1987). The bakery on Fifth Street (closed 1994). The way your dad's workshop used to smell before he stopped building things.

**Promises** that people made and then forgot. They're small and fragile—little wisps of light that flicker when you look at them. "I'll call you tomorrow." "We should do this again." "I'll never forget."

**Dreams** that people woke up from too early. They're half-finished, confused, trying to figure out their own endings.

**Names** that no one says anymore. The saddest ones. Names of people who died and everyone who knew them died too. Names that meant everything to someone and now mean nothing to anyone.

And **Imaginary Friends**. Hundreds of them. Thousands. All the creatures that children loved into existence and then grew out of. Some of them remember what they were. Some of them have faded so much they're just feelings now—just the sense that something used to be there.

## The Rules

1. **Attention makes things real.** The more you're noticed, the more solid you become. The less you're noticed, the more you fade.

2. **Noticing goes both ways.** When you really see something, it becomes more real—but so do you. Attention is a transaction. A gift exchange.

3. **You can't force someone to notice you.** Demanding attention doesn't work. Performing doesn't work. You can only be there, being yourself, and hope.

4. **Some things SHOULD fade.** Cruel words. Bad memories. Broken promises that hurt too much to keep. The Unnoticed isn't all tragedy—some things need to be let go.

5. **Nothing ever fully disappears.** Even the most faded thing leaves a trace. A feeling. A shape in the air where something used to be. Nothing is ever completely gone—just very, very quiet.

6. **Children see more.** Not because they're magic, but because they haven't learned yet what to ignore. Adults have been trained to unsee. Children still look at everything.

7. **Love isn't enough.** You can love someone completely and still not see them. Love without attention is just a feeling in your own head. Love that LOOKS is what makes the other person real.

## The Story Lives Here

This is the world. These are the beings.

The story is just a window—one small moment when Mote looked into her closet and saw Wisp, and everything that happened after.

But the world goes on. Before the story. After the story. Bigger than any story could hold.

Mote doesn't know all of this. She just knows a girl named Wisp who used to be a dragon, and a golden place full of half-forgotten things, and a family that might be learning to see each other again.

That's enough. That's the story.

Everything else is between the lines.
