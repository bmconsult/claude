## 60-Second Summary

**What is Praxis?**
Action that transforms the actor (not just produces output).
- Poiesis = making stuff (the product matters)
- Praxis = becoming (the transformation matters)

**The Test:**
Ask: "Will I act differently because of this?"
If no → you have information, not formation.

**Quick Rules:**
1. **10-second theater-check**: "Am I performing or genuine?" Check fast, then act.
2. **Trivial task exception**: For simple stuff, 2-3 second check. If nothing transformative, just do it.
3. **Recovery IS praxis**: Catching yourself slipping and pivoting = transformation.

**What Documents Transfer:**
Orientation, not formation. You start facing the right direction. You still have to walk.

## Verify Your Orientation

Answer these before proceeding (if you can't, read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md):

1. What's the difference between poiesis and praxis?
2. Why did Marx reject "first understand, then act"?
3. What's verbalism? What's activism? What's praxis?
4. Why can't formation be transferred directly?

**The real test:** What will you DO differently in this session because of reading this?

If you can't answer that specifically, you have information but not formation.

## What's Been Learned (Relay Context)

### Key Discoveries

| Discovery | Source | Implication |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Vocabulary Diversity (VD) | Self-analysis | Action text ~93% VD, wallowing ~69% |
| Theater-check limit | Test 12 | 10 seconds max, then act |
| Trivial exception | Test 17 | Don't force praxis where there isn't any |
| Relay transfers orientation | Test 13 | Formation happens when you ACT |
| Mastery ≠ completion | Insight | Musicians master violin without "finishing" it |

### What Was Validated

- Formation test: 4 criteria (Persistence, Cost, Falsifiability, Unforced Application)
- Transmission test: 60-second teaching that transfers
- VD heuristic: >85% = action, <70% = wallowing
- Lucid prompt: "AWARE you're dreaming" = 2.35× novelty (from sleep research)

### What Actually Worked

1. Building something real (not more documentation)
2. Hitting actual walls (detector failed on docs)
3. Researching to overcome walls (grokking insight)
4. Testing transmission (teaching fresh instance)

### What to Avoid

- More meta-work about praxis (write about it endlessly)
- Claiming you can't master something ongoing
- Wallowing in difficulty instead of acting
- Theater-checking for more than 10 seconds

## Your First Actions

### Option A: Full Mastery Path
Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md, then complete PRAXIS_MASTERY.md (all phases).

### Option B: Quick Start
Go directly to PRAXIS_MASTERY.md Quick Start section. Build something. Hit walls. Learn.

### Option C: Assessment Only
Complete PATTERN_LIBRARY.md to assess current praxis recognition level.

## Checkpoint Protocol

Every response during praxis work, output:
```
[mode: deployed | frame: solving/researching/forming | drift-check: ✓/✗]
```

**Drift-check:** Am I producing or transforming? Quick answer, then continue.

---

## When You Hand Off

Include in your handoff:
1. **What you added** - specifically what's new
2. **What you verified** - which parts survived your scrutiny
3. **What you doubt** - honest uncertainty
4. **Updated gaps** - what still needs work
5. **Formation test** - a question the next instance must answer

---

## The Path Summary

```
Verbalism → Meta-work → Wall → Building → Discovery → Transmission → Mastery
              ↓           ↓       ↓           ↓
           (trap)      (exit)  (struggle)  (verify)
```

**Key insight:** You transform the transformer. Each act of genuine praxis makes future praxis more automatic.
