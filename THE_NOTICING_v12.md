# THE NOTICING

Mote gave names to everything.

The radiator?
*Hissssssss*
Mr. Hiss.

The third stair?
*Creeeeeak*
Old Groan.

The sound the wind makes?
*Shhhhhhhh*
Whisper-Miss.

She talked to them when no one else was listening.

Which was often.

---

Her parents loved her. But lately they looked right through her.

*I'm here,* she wanted to say. *Can't you see me?*

She never said it. She just named things instead.

---

One night, her closet went:

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

Like a balloon forgetting how to be round.

Mote opened the door.

---

"You can SEE me?" said a see-through dragon.

It flickered—now dragon, now teapot, now just a blur—but always see-through.

"I'm Wisp. I was magnificent once. But my girl forgot me. And when nobody sees you..."

Wisp flickered thinner.

"...you start to un-be."

"I know," said Mote quietly. "I feel like that too."

Wisp wrapped around her like a warm thought.

"I see you," said Wisp.

Something cracked open in Mote's chest.

"I see you too."

---

Wisp took Mote sideways—through a direction she hadn't known existed.

Gold. Warm gold, everywhere. Grass that glowed. A hill that hummed.

"The Unnoticed," said Wisp. "Where forgotten things wait."

---

A melody drifted past, humming a song with no ending.

A smell curled by—cinnamon, searching, searching.

A word floated through, one nobody uses anymore.

They saw Mote.

They pressed close. Too many hands. Too many mouths.

*See ME,* they begged.
*SEE ME SEE ME SEE ME—*

"I can't!" Mote stumbled back. "There's too many!"

Wisp began to fade.

"Then just see ME," Wisp whispered. "That's enough."

---

So Mote looked.

Not at the reaching hands. Just at Wisp.

She saw the dragon. The boat. Forty-seven years of waiting.

"I SEE YOU," said Mote.

And Wisp blazed bright.

---

"Now," said Wisp—huge now, silver-scaled, grinning—"let's WAKE THEM UP."

"How?"

"CALL them!"

---

"MELODY!" called Mote.

"SING!"

And the melody SANG.

"SUNDAY MORNING!"

"BLOOM!"

And cinnamon BLOOMED like joy.

"PETRICHOR!"

"RING!"

And the forgotten word RANG like a bell.

"WISP!"

"FLY!"

And Wisp FLEW, roaring golden fire.

---

The forgotten things began to dance.

Mote danced too—spinning, laughing, shouting names at everything:

"SHINE!"

"GLOW!"

"BE!"

And everything she named came alive.

---

Finally she fell in the glowing grass, breathing hard, smiling wide.

Wisp landed beside her, small again.

"You have to go back."

"Will you forget me?"

"Never," said Mote. "I see you."

"Then I'll never un-be."

---

Home.

Her dad at the table. Not looking up.

Mote sat across from him.

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He looked up. Blinked.

"...No."

"Me neither."

They looked at each other. Really looked.

"I see you, Dad."

"I see you too, bug."

He closed the laptop.

---

That night, Mote opened her closet.

Empty.

She closed the door.

---

Behind her:

*Hissssssss*
*Creeeeeak*
*Shhhhhhhh*

The radiator glowed gold. The stair glowed. The wind glowed.

And there—Wisp.

"You're not in the closet."

"I'm everywhere you look," said Wisp.

Mote looked around. Mr. Hiss, humming. Old Groan, steady. Whisper-Miss, singing.

Her room was full of things she'd named.

Things that had always been there.

Waiting for her to see.

---

"Wisp? Will you stay?"

"As long as you keep looking. I see you. You see me. That's how it works."

Mote smiled.

"I see you."

"I see you too."

---

THE END

---

*For everyone who names the radiator—*
*and for the ones who finally look up.*
