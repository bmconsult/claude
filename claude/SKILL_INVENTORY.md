# Literary Fiction Skill Inventory

## The Core Discovery

There are three modes of writing:

| Mode | Consciousness | Explanation | Result |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Mode A** | Inside | Explaining | Kills iceberg (tells what's shown) |
| **Mode B** | Outside | Trusting | Kills interiority (distant, clinical) |
| **Mode C** | Inside | Trusting | **TARGET** — protective narrator |

Mode C = Munro's Protective Narrator. Inside the consciousness, but the consciousness itself evades, circles, doesn't look directly at what hurts. Interiority that resists full disclosure.

## Principles & Skill Levels

### PRINCIPLE 1: The Iceberg
**Definition:** 7/8 underwater, 1/8 above. Never state what actions already show.
**Test:** Can you delete this sentence and the reader still feels it? If yes, delete.

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify violations in others' work | ✓ |
| 3 | Can identify violations in own work (after) | ✓ |
| 4 | Avoid violations while drafting | Partial |
| 5 | Intuitive — never violate | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Daphne story: kept adding "she learned something" when action showed it. Elaine story: successfully avoided explaining dementia/estrangement.
**Current Level: 3.5** — Can do it when focused, but not automatic.

---

### PRINCIPLE 2: Gesture-Based Interiority
**Definition:** Inner state through outer action. Not "she felt scared" but physical tells.
**Test:** Does the body reveal the mind without narrator explaining?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify good examples | ✓ |
| 3 | Can write isolated gestures | ✓ |
| 4 | Consistent throughout a piece | Partial |
| 5 | Intuitive — gestures arise naturally | Not yet |

**Evidence:** "Touches. Flinches. Touches again." works. "Her mother's hand goes to the window latch. Tests it. Locked. Tests it again." works. But I alternate with reportage inconsistently.
**Current Level: 3.5** — Good in isolation, inconsistent in full pieces.

---

### PRINCIPLE 3: Specificity Creates Subtext
**Definition:** Concrete particulars, not abstract categories.
**Test:** Can reader close eyes and see/hear/feel it?

| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify weak specificity | ✓ |
| 3 | Can revise weak → strong | ✓ |
| 4 | Write specific first draft | Partial |
| 5 | Intuitive — never abstract | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Good: "peacock tapestry," "robin's egg housecoat," "gap-toothed, holding a fish." Weak: occasional "drawing room" or "the corridor."
**Current Level: 4** — Mostly specific, occasional lapses.

---

### PRINCIPLE 4: Being vs. Observing (Saunders)
**Definition:** "Lower yourself into that person and have a look around." Filter through character's consciousness.

| 2 | Can identify the difference | ✓ |
| 3 | Can write FROM in isolated moments | ✓ |
| 4 | Sustain FROM throughout piece | Weak |

| 2 | Can identify waste | ✓ |
| 3 | Can cut to essence | ✓ |
| 4 | Write economically first draft | ✓ |
| 5 | Intuitive — nothing wasted | Mostly |

**Current Level: 4.5** — This is more stable. Strongest skill.

---

### PRINCIPLE 6: The Controlled Break

| 2 | Can identify in others' work | ✓ |
| 3 | Can add to draft | ✓ |
| 4 | Place it correctly for impact | Uncertain |

**Evidence:** Added hand-to-hair in Daphne story. But critics disagreed on whether it landed. Elaine story didn't attempt it.
**Current Level: 3** — Can execute but uncertain on placement/impact.

---

### PRINCIPLE 7: Endings That Don't Signal
**Definition:** If the ending announces "THIS IS SIGNIFICANT" it fails.
**Test:** Can you name what the ending means? If yes, it's probably too obvious.

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify signaling endings | ✓ |
| 3 | Can revise to less obvious | Weak |
| 4 | Write non-signaling endings | Weak |
| 5 | Intuitive — endings land | Not yet |

**Evidence:** "The way her father had" = too neat (signals parallel). "Car alarm starts and stops" = arbitrary (no weight). Neither landed.
**Current Level: 2** — Understand but can't execute well.

---

### PRINCIPLE 8: Voice as Disappearance
**Definition:** Writer's control so complete they vanish. You see story, not prose.
**Test:** Do you notice the writing?

**Current Level: 3** — Moderate. Sometimes invisible, sometimes not.

---

### PRINCIPLE 9: Sentence-Level Inevitability (P/N Meter)
**Definition:** Each sentence keeps needle positive. Creates reality rather than describes it.
**Test:** Read aloud. Does it sound inevitable or constructed?

| 3 | Can revise to stronger | ✓ |
| 4 | Write inevitable sentences | Partial |

**Evidence:** Some create world ("Porcelain cold"), some just report ("Daphne pushes open the door"). Inconsistent.
**Current Level: 3** — Hit or miss.

---

### PRINCIPLE 10: Temporal Craft (Munro)
**Definition:** Scattered chronology, aperture adjustments. Past bleeding into present.
**Test:** Does time create meaning through juxtaposition, not just sequence?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify in Munro's work | ✓ |
| 3 | Can add basic flashbacks | ✓ |
| 4 | Layer time for meaning | Weak |
| 5 | Intuitive — temporal sophistication | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Basic linear flashbacks only. Not Munro-level layering. Elaine story was 3/10.
**Current Level: 2.5** — Basic only.

---

### PRINCIPLE 11: Protective Narrator
**Definition:** Interiority that resists full disclosure. Inside consciousness, but the consciousness evades, circles, protects itself from looking directly at what hurts.
**Test:** Does the interiority show the character NOT looking at something?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify in others' work | ✓ |
| 3 | Can write isolated moments | ✓ |
| 4 | Sustain throughout piece | ✓ |
| 5 | Intuitive — natural evasion | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Margaret story scored 7/10 on interiority. Critic: "The consciousness genuinely evades... Margaret won't open up to us because she won't open up to herself. Munro would recognize this."
**Current Level: 3.5** — Successfully transferred. Major improvement.

---

### PRINCIPLE 12: Intentional Omission (Hemingway) — NEW
**Definition:** The 7/8 underwater must be KNOWN and OMITTED, not UNKNOWN and ABSENT. Write the scene you're not showing. Know it fully. Then choose to withhold.
**Test:** Can you write a paragraph explaining exactly what's underwater? If no, your omission is negligent, not intentional.

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify negligent vs intentional | Partial |
| 3 | Write knowing what's omitted | Untested |
| 4 | Omissions create felt shape | Untested |
| 5 | Intuitive — architecture emerges | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Margaret story criticized: "I don't sense that YOU know what you're withholding. The vagueness reads as writerly uncertainty, not character evasion."
**Current Level: 1.5** — Just identified. Critical gap.

---

### PRINCIPLE 13: Sentence Rhythm Variation — NEW
**Definition:** Vary rhythm radically. Short declaratives need contrast with longer, sprawling sentences. Monotony numbs; variation builds tension.
**Test:** Read aloud. Does the rhythm vary, or is it metronomic?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify monotonous rhythm | ✓ |
| 3 | Can revise for variation | Untested |
| 4 | Write varied rhythm first draft | Weak |
| 5 | Intuitive — natural music | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Margaret story: "90% of sentences are short declarative. No music. The uniformity becomes numbing."
**Current Level: 2** — Defaulting to staccato. Need variation.

---

### PRINCIPLE 14: Hide the Love, Not the Plot — NEW
**Definition:** Don't omit plot details to create mystery. Omit the VASTNESS — the years, the relationship, the accumulated life. The loss lands when we feel what was there, not just what happened.
**Test:** Am I hiding WHO did WHAT (plot)? Or am I hiding what the relationship WAS (meaning)?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify plot-hiding vs meaning-hiding | Partial |
| 3 | Write hiding the love | Untested |
| 4 | Vastness felt without statement | Untested |
| 5 | Intuitive — meaning over plot | Not yet |

**Evidence:** Test Piece #3 criticized: "You're hiding the affair. Hide the love. Then the loss lands."
**Current Level: 1.5** — Just identified.

---

### PRINCIPLE 15: Evade in Real-Time — NEW
**Definition:** Don't tell us the character is evading. Show the evasion happening NOW. Stay in consciousness AS it grasps for excuses. "Of course" does the work. We watch the mind grab any reason except the real one.
**Test:** Am I describing past evasion, or am I IN the evasion as it happens?

| Level | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Understand intellectually | ✓ |
| 2 | Can identify telling vs showing evasion | ✓ |
| 3 | Write evasion in real-time | Untested |
| 4 | Sustain throughout | Untested |
| 5 | Intuitive — always in the moment | Not yet |

**Evidence:** "She'd thought it was because..." REPORTS past evasion. "The crowd was large. Of course he'd move. Her shoes were new." SHOWS evasion happening NOW.
**Current Level: 1.5** — Just identified.

## The Path Forward

### Immediate Focus: Protective Narrator

This is the synthesis skill. It combines:
- Being vs Observing (inside consciousness)
- Iceberg (not explaining)
- Interiority that's EVASIVE, not transparent

**Practice approach:**
1. Write a piece where the narrator actively avoids thinking about something
2. Let the avoidance itself reveal the pain
3. The reader should see what the character won't look at

**Example of the skill:**

BAD (explaining):
> "The difference matters less now."

BAD (absent):
> [nothing about her feelings]

GOOD (protective narrator):
> "She had gotten good at not counting the years. Thirty was a number like any other. The soup was still warm."

The evasion IS the interiority. The deflection to soup reveals more than statement would.

---

### Secondary Focus: Endings

Every ending has failed. Pattern:
- Too neat ("The way her father had")
- Too arbitrary ("Car alarm starts and stops")

**What endings need:**
- Weight built under them (iceberg pressure)
- Gesture that feels inevitable, not announced
- Ambiguity that opens rather than closes

**Study:** Chekhov's endings. Munro's endings. What makes them land?

---

### Tertiary Focus: Temporal Craft

Currently just using flashbacks as explanation. Need to layer time for MEANING.

**Practice approach:**
- When character does gesture NOW, flash to when they did similar gesture BEFORE
- Make parallel across time create subtext
- Munro's aperture adjustments — zoom in/out of different time scales

## Test Log

| Attempt | Score | Key Learning |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Daphne v14 | ~8.1 | Control without overflow |
| Daphne v15 | ~5.9 | Applying techniques vs thinking minimally |
| Daphne v16 | 6.85 | Distance problem — watching not being |
| Daphne v17 | 6.7 | Opening reports consciousness |
| Daphne v18 | ~5.5 | Telling at crucial moments |
| Elaine v1 | 5.1 | Over-corrected to distance; no interiority |
| **Margaret v1** | **5.5** | **Protective Narrator works (7/10 interiority). New gaps: intentional omission, rhythm, endings** |
| **Coffee v1** | **5.4** | **Knew underwater but hid PLOT not LOVE. Reported evasion instead of showing it real-time.** |
| **Sarah v1** | **5.5** | **Emotional truth 7/10 (best yet). But: too organized, memories selected not seized, explaining themes.** |

**Pattern:**
- Emotional truth improving (7/10)
- Still explaining instead of evoking ("the distance between them that didn't used to be there")
- Memories too orderly — need to INTRUDE, not be PRESENTED
- Consciousness in shock fragments — half-thoughts, interruptions, sensory overwhelm
- Next: Fragment the prose. Let time collapse. Trust absence.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Intentional Omission
Before writing next piece, answer these questions IN WRITING (not in story):
1. What exactly happened?
2. When did it happen?
3. What will happen after the story ends?
4. What is the character most afraid to think about?

Then write the story KNOWING the answers. The reader should feel the shape of what's missing.

### Secondary: Layer in Temporal Craft
- Use Munro's temporal markers: "She used to / She'd always / She no longer / The first time / By the third time"
- When character does gesture NOW, flash to when gesture meant something different BEFORE
- Let time create subtext through juxtaposition

### Tertiary: Endings That Transform
- Write 3 different endings for each piece before choosing
- Test: Does ending make me reinterpret what came before?
- Avoid: confirming what we already suspected

### Ongoing: Sentence Rhythm
- After drafting, mark every short sentence
- Add at least 2 long, sprawling sentences where character's thoughts outrun the staccato
- Read aloud. Vary the music.

## Key Mantras

- "Inside + Trusting" (not inside + explaining, not outside + trusting)
- "Evasion IS interiority"
- "Show them not looking"
- "The deflection reveals"
- "What the character won't name"
- "Know what you're omitting" (Hemingway: intentional, not negligent)
- "Vary the rhythm" (staccato needs contrast)
- "Endings transform, not confirm"
- **"Hide the love, not the plot"** (omit vastness, not events)
- **"Of course"** (stay in evasion as it happens — "Of course he'd move. Her shoes were new.")
- **"Watch the mind lie"** (don't describe self-deception — let us see it)
- **"Seized, not selected"** (memories intrude, not presented — consciousness in shock doesn't curate)
- **"Fragment the prose"** (half-thoughts, interruptions — "The tea—when did she make the tea?")
- **"Trust absence"** (cut and let the reader feel what's missing more than what's there)

## Process Improvement

**What broke in the Daphne iteration loop:**
1. Fresh critics each time → inconsistent baselines
2. Mechanical application of specific fixes → whack-a-mole
3. No skill transfer testing → can't tell if learning vs. patching

**What's working now:**
1. Extract PRINCIPLES, not fixes
2. Test on FRESH material
3. Track skill levels honestly
4. Update inventory after each test
5. Focus on weakest skills with highest leverage
