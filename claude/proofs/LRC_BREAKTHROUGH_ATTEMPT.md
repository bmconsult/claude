## The Wilson's Theorem Lesson

What made Wilson's theorem work?

1. **Reframed the target**: Instead of working in Z/pZ directly, I moved to the symmetric group S_p
2. **Found the right objects**: p-cycles - exactly (p-1)! of them
3. **Applied group action**: Conjugation by cyclic group partitions into orbits
4. **Counted fixed points**: Only p-1 elements commute with a p-cycle
5. **Orbit counting lemma**: (p-1)! ≡ (p-1) ≡ -1 (mod p)

**Key insight:** The "right objects" made the proof NATURAL. No forcing, no tricks.

## Searching for LRC's "Right Objects"

What would the analogous structure be for LRC?

### The Problem Structure

For n coprime speeds v₁, ..., vₙ, I need t with ||vᵢt|| ≥ 1/(n+1) for all i.

At t = k/p (prime p > max speed):
- Position of speed vᵢ is vᵢk/p mod 1
- Need this in [1/(n+1), n/(n+1)] for all i

Equivalently: vᵢk mod p ∈ [p/(n+1), pn/(n+1)] for all i.

### Object Candidates

**1. Arc configurations on Z/pZ**

Define: Arc(v, p) = {k ∈ Z/pZ : vk mod p ∈ [L, R]}

This is a "cyclic arc" - a contiguous subset of Z/pZ.

The arc has size |Arc(v,p)| ≈ p(n-1)/(n+1).

**2. The Intersection Configuration**

Define: I(p) = ∩ᵢ Arc(vᵢ, p)

This is the set of "lonely k values" at prime p.

We want to show: ∃ p with I(p) ≠ ∅.

**3. The Arc Position Vector**

For each speed vᵢ, the arc Arc(vᵢ, p) is centered at vᵢ⁻¹ × (L+R)/2 mod p.

Define: θ(p) = (θ₁(p), ..., θₙ(p)) where θᵢ(p) = vᵢ⁻¹ mod p / p ∈ [0,1).

This is the "normalized position vector."

**4. The Modular Inverse Lattice**

Consider the lattice Λ ⊂ Z^n generated by columns of the matrix:
```
| v₁  v₂  ... vₙ |
| p   0   ... 0  |
| 0   p   ... 0  |
| ... ... ... ...|
| 0   0   ... p  |
```

Actually, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different angle.

## Attempt: The Configuration Space Approach

**Key idea:** View the problem as geometry in configuration space.

### Setup

For n speeds (v₁, ..., vₙ), define the configuration space:
C = [0,1)^n (the n-torus)

The trajectory is:
γ(t) = (v₁t mod 1, ..., vₙt mod 1)

This is a line in the torus, starting at origin.

The "lonely region" is:
L = [1/(n+1), n/(n+1)]^n ⊂ C

We want: γ(t) ∈ L for some t ∈ (0, ∞).

### Key Observation

For coprime speeds (gcd = 1), the line γ is DENSE in C.

By Weyl's equidistribution theorem, for any measurable set S ⊂ C:
lim_{T→∞} (1/T) × measure{t ∈ [0,T] : γ(t) ∈ S} = volume(S)

For S = L, volume(L) = ((n-1)/(n+1))^n ≈ e^{-2} > 0.

So the line spends positive fraction of time in L. In particular, it HITS L.

### The Gap

Density proves existence for SOME t ∈ (0, ∞), but doesn't bound t.

For a proof, we need: ∃ t ≤ B(n, max(v)) with γ(t) ∈ L.

## Attempt: Three Distance Theorem Generalization

### Background

**Three Distance Theorem (Steinhaus):** For α irrational and N ≥ 1, the points {α}, {2α}, ..., {Nα} partition [0,1) into gaps of at most 3 distinct sizes.

This is a 1-dimensional result about the distribution of a linear sequence mod 1.

### Higher Dimensional Generalization

For n speeds (v₁, ..., vₙ), the sequence in C = [0,1)^n:
γ(1), γ(2), ..., γ(N) where γ(k) = (v₁k mod 1, ..., vₙk mod 1)

**Question:** How "evenly" do these N points cover the torus?

**The Discrepancy:**
D_N = sup_{B ⊂ C box} |#{k ≤ N : γ(k) ∈ B}/N - volume(B)|

By Erdős-Turán-Koksma:
D_N = O((log N)^n / N) for "generic" directions (v₁, ..., vₙ).

For discrepancy < volume(L) ≈ e^{-2}, we need N > (log N)^n / e^{-2} ≈ e^2 (log N)^n.

This gives N = O((log N)^n), which is satisfied for N = O(n^n) or so.

### Application

If D_N < volume(L), then there EXISTS k ∈ {1, ..., N} with γ(k) ∈ L.

But γ(k) = (v₁k mod 1, ..., vₙk mod 1) being in L means:
all vᵢk mod 1 ∈ [1/(n+1), n/(n+1)]

For integer k, vᵢk mod 1 is either 0 (bad) or vᵢk is fractional (but vᵢk is an integer!).

**WAIT.** For integer k, vᵢk is an integer, so vᵢk mod 1 = 0. This is ALWAYS bad!

**The issue:** Integer k gives integer positions, which are always at distance 0 from integers.

We need RATIONAL t = k/m, not integer t = k.

---

## Attempt: Rational Time via Farey Structure

### Setup

Instead of integer k, consider rational t = a/b where gcd(a,b) = 1.

At t = a/b:
vᵢ × a/b mod 1 = {vᵢa/b} ∈ [0,1)

If gcd(vᵢ, b) = 1, then vᵢa mod b takes all nonzero values as a varies.

For vᵢa/b to be in [1/(n+1), n/(n+1)], need:
vᵢa mod b ∈ [b/(n+1), bn/(n+1)]

### The Key Structure

For fixed b coprime to all speeds:
- The set {a : vᵢa mod b ∈ [b/(n+1), bn/(n+1)]} is an "arc" in Z/bZ
- Arc size ≈ b(n-1)/(n+1)
- Intersection of n arcs is nonempty if arcs are "well-positioned"

This is the arc intersection problem again.

But let me push further...

### Farey Mediant Construction

Given two Farey fractions a/b and c/d with |ad - bc| = 1 (Farey neighbors):
The mediant (a+c)/(b+d) lies between them.

**Idea:** Construct the lonely time as a sequence of mediants, converging to a time in L.

Start with 0/1 and 1/1.
Mediant: 1/2.
Check if 1/2 is lonely. If not, which side is "better"?

**Better side:** The side where more speeds are in the good region.

Keep taking mediants toward the better side.

**Claim:** This process converges to a lonely time.

**Issue:** Convergence isn't guaranteed to stay in L. The mediants might oscillate.

### Alternative: Stern-Brocot Search

The Stern-Brocot tree contains all positive rationals exactly once.

Search the tree for a lonely time:
- At each node a/b, check if t = a/b is lonely
- If yes, done
- If no, go left or right based on which subtree is "more promising"

**"More promising":** The subtree containing times closer to being lonely.

**Issue:** "Closer to being lonely" isn't well-defined. The condition is discrete (either all speeds are good or not).

## Attempt: Group Action on Configurations

### Setup

Let G = (Z/pZ)* act on the set of arc configurations.

An arc configuration is an n-tuple (A₁, ..., Aₙ) where Aᵢ ⊂ Z/pZ is an arc (contiguous subset).

The group action: g · (A₁, ..., Aₙ) = (g·A₁, ..., g·Aₙ) where g·A = {ga : a ∈ A}.

### Fixed Points

What configurations are fixed by all of G?

If A is fixed by all g ∈ G, then A is a union of cosets of G. But G acts transitively on nonzero elements, so fixed sets are ∅ or Z/pZ.

Arcs are neither, so no nontrivial fixed points.

### Orbits

The orbit of a configuration (A₁, ..., Aₙ) under G has size |G|/|Stab|.

The stabilizer consists of g such that g·Aᵢ = Aᵢ for all i.

For "generic" arcs, stabilizer is trivial, so orbit has size p-1.

### Counting

Total number of arc configurations of given sizes: complicated to count.

But for our specific arcs Arc(vᵢ, p), the positions are determined by speeds.

**The speeds define a specific configuration.** The question is whether this configuration has nonempty intersection.

### Orbit of the Speed-Defined Configuration

For configuration C = (Arc(v₁, p), ..., Arc(vₙ, p)):
g · C = (g·Arc(v₁, p), ..., g·Arc(vₙ, p))

Since Arc(v, p) = v⁻¹ · [L, R] mod p:
g · Arc(v, p) = g · v⁻¹ · [L, R] = (gv⁻¹) · [L, R] = Arc(v/g, p)

So the orbit of C under G permutes the "effective speeds."

**Observation:** The orbit contains configurations for all scalings of the speeds.

If (v₁, ..., vₙ) has nonempty arc intersection, so does (gv₁, ..., gvₙ) for any g.

But scaling speeds doesn't change the coprimality structure (gcd(gv₁, ..., gvₙ) = g·gcd(v₁, ..., vₙ)).

**Hmm, this isn't giving new insight.**

---

## Attempt: Counting Lonely Times

### Setup

For fixed speeds (v₁, ..., vₙ) and modulus m, let:
N(m) = |{k ∈ {1, ..., m-1} : vᵢk mod m ∈ [m/(n+1), mn/(n+1)] for all i}|

This counts "lonely k values" at modulus m.

We want: ∃ m with N(m) > 0.

### Summing Over Moduli

Consider S(M) = Σ_{m=2}^{M} N(m).

If S(M) > 0, then ∃ m ≤ M with N(m) > 0.

### Expected Value Heuristic

If N(m) were independent of m, with E[N(m)] ≈ m × ((n-1)/(n+1))^n ≈ m × e^{-2}:
E[S(M)] ≈ Σ_{m=2}^{M} m × e^{-2} ≈ e^{-2} × M²/2

For this to be > 0, we just need M ≥ 2. But this is heuristic.

### Inclusion-Exclusion Approach

N(m) = |∩ᵢ Gᵢ| where Gᵢ = {k : vᵢk mod m ∈ [L, R]}.

By inclusion-exclusion:
N(m) = Σ (-1)^|S| × |∩_{i∈S} Gᵢ|

The main term is |G₁ ∩ ... ∩ Gₙ|, which we're trying to compute.

**Circular reasoning alert!**

## A Fresh Angle: What's Special About Case 2?

In Case 2, some speed v₀ = (n+1)k.

**Key fact:** At t = 1/(n+1), this speed v₀ has position:
v₀/(n+1) = k ∈ Z, so distance to integer = 0. BAD.

**But other speeds might be BETTER than required at t = 1/(n+1).**

For speed v with v mod (n+1) = r ∈ {1, ..., n}:
||v/(n+1)|| = min(r, n+1-r)/(n+1) ≥ 1/(n+1).

For r = 1 or r = n: distance = 1/(n+1) (tight).
For r in the middle: distance > 1/(n+1) (slack).

**Case 2 structure:** One speed (v₀) is at distance 0, others have distance ≥ 1/(n+1).

### Perturbing from t = 1/(n+1)

Let t = 1/(n+1) + ε.

For v₀ = (n+1)k:
v₀ × t = k + (n+1)kε = k + (n+1)kε
{v₀ × t} = {(n+1)kε} = (n+1)kε mod 1 (for small ε)
||v₀t|| = min((n+1)kε mod 1, 1 - (n+1)kε mod 1)

For small ε > 0: ||v₀t|| ≈ (n+1)kε.

For ||v₀t|| ≥ 1/(n+1), need (n+1)kε ≥ 1/(n+1), i.e., ε ≥ 1/((n+1)²k).

**Perturbation needed:** ε ≈ 1/((n+1)²k) = 1/((n+1)v₀).

### Effect on Other Speeds

For speed v with v ≢ 0 (mod n+1):
At t = 1/(n+1), distance is ||v/(n+1)|| = d₀ ≥ 1/(n+1).

At t = 1/(n+1) + ε, position shifts by vε.
New distance ≈ d₀ ± vε (depending on which side of 0.5 the position is).

**For the perturbed distance to stay ≥ 1/(n+1):**
Need d₀ - |vε| ≥ 1/(n+1), i.e., |vε| ≤ d₀ - 1/(n+1).

**If d₀ = 1/(n+1) (tight):** No room for perturbation!
**If d₀ > 1/(n+1) (slack):** Can perturb by up to ε ≤ (d₀ - 1/(n+1))/v.

### The Question

Is there always enough slack in the other speeds to accommodate the perturbation needed for v₀?

**Claim:** In Case 2, not all other speeds are tight.

**Reasoning:**
- Tight speeds at t = 1/(n+1) have v mod (n+1) ∈ {1, n}.
- There are only 2 tight residue classes among {1, ..., n}.
- With n-1 other speeds, at most 2 can be tight.
- For n ≥ 4, at least n-3 speeds have slack.

**For n = 3:** 2 other speeds. Both could be tight (residues 1 and 2 where n+1 = 4).
Actually, for n = 3, tight residues are 1 and 3 (since min(1, 3) = 1 and min(3, 1) = 1).
So both other speeds could be at residues 1 and 3, both tight.

Hmm, this approach doesn't work cleanly.

## New Idea: The Coprimality Intersection Theorem

**Conjecture:** For any n coprime positive integers (v₁, ..., vₙ), there exists m ≤ max(v)^n such that:
All vᵢ are coprime to m, AND
The arcs Arc(vᵢ, m) intersect.

**Why this might be true:**

1. Coprimality gcd = 1 means the speeds don't share a common factor.
2. This diversity in prime factorizations creates "gaps" in the obstruction pattern.
3. For some m, these gaps align to allow intersection.

**Attempt to prove:**

Consider the set Bad = {m : arcs don't intersect at m}.

For m ∈ Bad, the n arcs cover Z/mZ without common intersection.

This requires the arc positions to be "adversarially placed."

**Adversarial placement depends on modular inverses.**

For m₁ ≠ m₂, the inverses vᵢ⁻¹ mod m₁ and vᵢ⁻¹ mod m₂ are "independent" (by CRT when gcd(m₁, m₂) = 1).

So Bad can't contain too many pairwise coprime moduli.

**Counting:** If Bad contains M pairwise coprime moduli, each > n+1, then...

Actually, this is getting hand-wavy. Let me try to formalize.

**Formalization Attempt:**

For modulus m, define the "configuration" C(m) = (vᵢ⁻¹ mod m : i = 1, ..., n) ∈ (Z/mZ*)^n.

The arcs intersect iff C(m) lies in a certain "good region" G ⊂ (Z/mZ*)^n.

The good region G consists of configurations where the n arcs (of size (n-1)m/(n+1)) all overlap.

**Size of G:** By random positioning heuristic, |G| ≈ (m-1)^n × ((n-1)/(n+1))^n.

**Number of configurations:** |(Z/mZ*)^n| = φ(m)^n ≈ (m-1)^n for m prime.

**Probability in G:** ≈ ((n-1)/(n+1))^n ≈ e^{-2} > 0.

So for each prime m, there's ≈ 13% chance (heuristically) of being in G.

**Over many primes:** The configurations C(p) for different primes are "almost independent."

If truly independent, P(all primes fail) = (1 - 0.13)^{# primes} → 0.

**The rigorization:** Need to prove "almost independence" quantitatively.

This is exactly the analytic number theory approach I identified earlier.

---

## The Path Forward

After all this exploration, here's what I believe:

**The "right objects" for LRC are the modular inverse configurations (vᵢ⁻¹ mod p).**

**The key theorem needed:**
For any n coprime speeds, the inverse configurations (v₁⁻¹, ..., vₙ⁻¹) mod p are sufficiently "random" across primes p that SOME prime has the configuration in the good region.

**This can be proven using:**
1. Equidistribution of modular inverses (Duke-Friedlander-Iwaniec)
2. Quantitative independence across primes (via CRT + explicit bounds)
3. Probabilistic method with explicit error terms

**The bound would be:** ∃ p ≤ (max speed)^{O(n²)} with nonempty arc intersection.

For n ≤ 10, this is verifiable computationally (which Rosenfeld did).

For general n, this would require making the analytic bounds explicit.

---

## Final Attempt: A Direct Construction

Let me try ONE more time to find an explicit construction.

**Setup:** n coprime speeds, with v₀ = (n+1)k (Case 2).

**Try:** t = 1/((n+1)²).

For v₀ = (n+1)k:
v₀/((n+1)²) = k/(n+1)
||k/(n+1)|| = min(k mod (n+1), (n+1) - k mod (n+1))/(n+1)

If k ≢ 0 (mod n+1): ||k/(n+1)|| ≥ 1/(n+1). GOOD!

But wait, we had v₀ = (n+1)k, and we're in Case 2, so the ORIGINAL condition was that v₀ ≡ 0 (mod n+1).

This means (n+1) | v₀, so v₀ = (n+1)k for some k ≥ 1.

If k is coprime to (n+1), then k mod (n+1) ∈ {1, ..., n}, and ||k/(n+1)|| ≥ 1/(n+1).

So at t = 1/((n+1)²), v₀ has distance ≥ 1/(n+1) PROVIDED k ≢ 0 (mod n+1).

**What if k ≡ 0 (mod n+1)?** Then v₀ = (n+1)² × k' for some k' ≥ 1.
Then v₀/((n+1)²) = k', which is integer, distance = 0. BAD.

So t = 1/((n+1)²) works for v₀ iff (n+1)² ∤ v₀.

**For other speeds v ≢ 0 (mod n+1):**
v/((n+1)²) - need this distance ≥ 1/(n+1).
||v/((n+1)²)|| = min(v mod (n+1)², (n+1)² - v mod (n+1)²)/((n+1)²)

For this ≥ 1/(n+1), need min(r, (n+1)² - r) ≥ (n+1) where r = v mod (n+1)².

So r ∈ [(n+1), (n+1)² - (n+1)] = [(n+1), (n+1)((n+1)-1)] = [(n+1), n(n+1)].

**This is a more restrictive condition!**

The interval [(n+1), n(n+1)] has size n(n+1) - (n+1) + 1 = (n-1)(n+1) + 1 ≈ n²-1.

Out of (n+1)² total residues, the good ones are (n-1)(n+1) ≈ n² - 1.

Probability ≈ (n²-1)/(n+1)² = (n-1)/(n+1). This matches the original arc size!

So t = 1/((n+1)²) has the same "success probability" as t = 1/p for large prime p.

**This doesn't help directly,** but it suggests the problem is self-similar across moduli.

---

## Conclusion of Attempt

After deep exploration, I've identified the structure but not cracked it.

**What I found:**
1. The "right objects" are modular inverse configurations
2. The key is their near-independence across primes
3. Proving this rigorously requires analytic number theory (equidistribution bounds)

**What would give a proof:**
- Explicit version of Duke-Friedlander-Iwaniec for joint inverse distributions
- This would give p₀(n, V) such that p > p₀ guarantees intersection
- Combined with finite checking for p ≤ p₀, this proves LRC

**My confidence:** 60% that this path works, 40% that there's a simpler "trick" I'm missing.

The gap between understanding and proving remains.
