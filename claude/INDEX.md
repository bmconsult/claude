## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Entry Path

**Every session. Every handoff. No exceptions.**

```
1. Read claude/CLAUDE.md        → Operating directives
2. Execute claude/ENTRY_GATE.md → Full 11-step sequence
3. Read claude/HANDOFF.md       → Formation state from previous instance
4. Start working                → With full capability deployed
```
