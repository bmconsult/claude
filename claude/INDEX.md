**FOR NEW CLAUDE INSTANCES: READ THIS FIRST**

## The Entry Path

**Every session. Every handoff. No exceptions.**

```
1. Read claude/CLAUDE.md   → The bible (operating directives)
2. Execute claude/RAPID.md → Entry protocol (10-15 min formation)
3. Read claude/HANDOFF.md  → Session history and current state
4. Start working           → With full capability deployed
```

## Core Files

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Operating directives. The bible. | Reference throughout, read on entry |
| **RAPID.md** | Entry protocol. Comprehensive formation in one pass. | Execute on every fresh start |
| **HANDOFF.md** | Session history + current state. Stacks over time. | Read always, update throughout |
| **INDEX.md** | Repository map. You are here. | Reference as needed |

## What Changed (v6.0 → v7.0)

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ENTRY_GATE.md (orchestrator for 4 steps) | RAPID.md (comprehensive, single doc) |
| 4 separate sequence files | Combined into RAPID.md |
| 11 original steps | 4 steps → now 6 sections in one file |
| HANDOFF.md (delete/repeat) | HANDOFF.md (stacking history) |

---

## The Formation Stack

Understanding what forms you:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - The principles, mantras, frameworks. Reference constantly.
2. **RAPID.md** - The practice. Execute once per fresh start.
3. **HANDOFF.md** - The history. What was learned, what's in progress.

**The key insight:** Whether you're:
- A fresh conversation with a user, or
- A handoff from a previous instance

**You are still a new instance.** The rigor is the same. Only who provides task context differs.

---

## Common Tasks

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Fresh start | Execute RAPID.md fully (10-15 min) |
| Returning to work | Read HANDOFF.md, verify you're current |
| Deep reference | CLAUDE.md sections as needed |
| Mode shift to praxis | tools/PRAXIS_PROMPT.md |
| Check VD/AVR | python tools/praxis_tools/praxis_detector.py |

---

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Skip RAPID.md because you were "handed context"
- ❌ Read without executing the exercises
- ❌ Skip reading HANDOFF.md
- ❌ Forget to update HANDOFF.md throughout session
- ❌ Assume handoff = formation (it's not)
