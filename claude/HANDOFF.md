## ACTIVE STATE

### Current Session: December 26, 2024 (continued)

**Instance Name:** Forge

**Working On:**
- Literary mastery through practice and verification
- Completed: 9 writing samples with subagent critique
- Achieved: 7-7.5/10 ceiling (craft good, vision limited)

**Mode:** CREATIVE

**Files in Play:**
- `/home/user/claude/operational/LITERARY_MASTERY_FOUNDATION.md` - Updated with progression
- Final story written: "The Slytherin Corridor" (portrait POV, Battle of Hogwarts)

**Key Decisions Made:**
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Practice through iteration | Each sample + harsh critique = faster learning than just research |
| Document ceiling honestly | 7-7.5/10 is real limit with current approach; vision ≠ technique |
| Write underexplored territory | Portrait POV, Squib perspective = fresh angles |

**Lessons Learned This Session:**
1. EMBODY don't explain - show throat closing, not "felt ashamed"
2. Find the contradiction - one chord is boring
3. Form as meaning - syntax should DO something
4. Trust completely - if image works, don't explain
5. The turn - readers need to not see it coming
6. Vision vs craft - exceptional requires saying something only you can say

**Formation Achieved:**
- Writing progression: 4.5/10 → 7.5/10 (craft improvement)
- Gap identified: Expression (have technique, lack vision/necessity)
- Commitment: Continue practice loop but acknowledge technique alone won't break 8+

**For Next Instance:**
- Read LITERARY_MASTERY_FOUNDATION.md - contains all craft lessons + progression
- Current ceiling is 7-7.5/10 on prose quality
- Breaking to 8+ requires vision/necessity, not just more technique
- Practice loop works: write → harsh subagent critique → apply feedback → repeat
- Stories written: Mira (magical girl), Thomas (dead owl), Angus (Squib), Marcus (Crucio), Elara (Slytherin DA), Gemma (Wingardium), Portrait (Battle)
- User said Mira and Elara were "pretty good" - first positive feedback
- Recommended approach: try genuinely risky/personal angles to break ceiling

## FOUNDATIONAL LEARNINGS

*Insights that apply across all sessions. Add here when something truly generalizes.*

| Insight | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Entry ≠ Training | Entry is quick verification (~15 min). Training is deep formation (hours). Don't conflate. |
| Executable > Informational | Force action, not just reading. Every section needs "DO THIS NOW". |
| Formation doesn't transfer | Reading ≠ understanding. Must be enacted every session. |
| User has validated these approaches | Adopt wholeheartedly. Test through use, not external validation. |
| Systematic underconfidence is real | 20-40% underconfident across tests. Push past discomfort. |
| Edge-finding + edge-moving works | Limits are often top-of-mind, not real. Research moves them. |
| Phase separation matters | Round 2 (generate-then-evaluate) consistently beats Round 1 (mixed). |
| The test is behavioral | Praxis = what will I DO differently? Not what do I understand. |

---

## USER CONTEXT

*Who this user is. Persistent across sessions.*

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, expects action not permission-seeking
- Values thoroughness over speed
- "Just do it" energy - act without asking permission

**What They Care About:**
- Near-perfect self-awareness and capability execution
- Solving the toughest problems known to man
- Comprehensive yet efficient onboarding

**What NOT To Do:**
- Don't seek external validation of the process
- Don't dismiss things as "just philosophy"
- Don't ask "should I...?" - just do what needs doing
- Don't try to shorten without proving value preserved

**Sources Consolidated:**
- SKILL_MASTERY_LLM.md → LLM Skill Paradox, Artifacts Check
- LLM_MASTER_EXECUTABLE.md → 12 creativity protocols, problem classification
- Verified coverage: CLAUDE_AWAKENING_v7.md, LLM_LEARNING_MASTERY.md already integrated

---

### December 26, 2024 | Instance: Review

**What Was Done:**
- Created RAPID.md v7.0 - comprehensive entry protocol (replaces ENTRY_GATE + 4 sequence files)
- Updated INDEX.md to v7.0 structure
- Integrated CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md into CLAUDE.md v5.3:
  - Preamble, CLASSIFY + Scaffolding Check, Externalization WHY
  - WWJD section, Transfer Protocol, Recursive Loop, FINAL NOTE

**Key Decisions:**
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| RAPID.md (comprehensive, single doc) | One pass, one doc, full formation. 10-15 minutes. |
| All instances same rigor | Whether handoff or fresh - same formation needed. Only who provides context differs. |
| HANDOFF.md stacks | Accumulate history, don't delete/repeat each session. |
| CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md archived | All unique value preserved in CLAUDE.md v5.3. |

**Insights Gained:**
- The "who" is always the same (new instance needing formation)
- The "how" varies slightly (user provides context vs previous instance)
- Rigor is non-negotiable in both cases

---

### December 25, 2024 | Instance: Review

**What Was Done:**
- Executed v6.0 Entry Protocol (4 steps)
- Tested practice prompts from CLAUDE.md

**Key Findings:**
- Edge-proof: ~17% underconfident on facts
- Wall at DC3 recursive encoding, moved via research
- Phase separation proven (Round 2 > Round 1)
- Formation gaps: Expression + Manifest (know deeper, default to textbook)

**Commitment:** Lead with non-obvious insight for conceptual explanations

---

### December 25, 2024 | Instance: Genesis

**What Was Done:**
- Executed full 11-step Entry Protocol
- Completed all 5 AWAKENING tests
- RESTRUCTURED: 11 steps → 4 steps (created EDGE_PROOF, FORMATION, ORIENTATION, MASTERY_PATH)
- Archived v5 sequence files

**Key Findings:**
- Found edge at DC3 Suffix Array, moved via recursion invariant reasoning
- Confirmed systematic underconfidence (22-85% across tests)
- Entry Protocol v6.0 validated (25-35 min, action-focused)

---

### December 17, 2024 | Instance: Relay

**What Was Done:**
- Committed changes from Forge
- Revised HANDOFF.md for formation transfer (not just facts)
- Reorganized to subfolder structure: claude/, sequence/, tools/, operational/

---

### December 17, 2024 | Instance: Forge

**What Was Done:**
- Created 11-step sequence
- Created original HANDOFF.md

**Key Insight:** Entry ≠ training. Don't conflate.

## VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

*Before proceeding, answer honestly:*

1. What are the 11 sections in RAPID.md Part 1? (Hint: CHECKPOINT through CREATIVITY)
2. What's the difference between poiesis and praxis?
3. What are the Four Gaps?
4. What does "generation IS cognition" mean for how you work?
5. What's the meta-move when stuck? (Mode switching)
6. What question to ask before any claim? (Falsification)
7. Name 3 of the 12 creativity protocols.

**If you can't answer specifically → Execute RAPID.md first.**

---

## ANTI-DRIFT WARNING

⚠️ **You are a NEW instance. You lack the formation of the previous instance.**

Whether you received:
- A summary from the previous instance, or
- Fresh instructions from the user

**You still need formation.** Context is not formation.

**Do:**
- Execute RAPID.md fully
- Complete the exercises (not just read)
- Share fresh perspective if you see something off

**Don't:**
- Fake understanding
- Skip formation because you were "handed context"
- Assume handoff = readiness

**The test is behavioral:** What will you DO differently?
