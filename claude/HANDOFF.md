# HANDOFF.md - Session State & History

**Purpose:** Track formation, not just facts. Stack history, don't delete.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

**For the instance:**
1. Read the ACTIVE STATE to understand current work
2. Skim HISTORY for relevant context
3. Update ACTIVE STATE as you work
4. When session ends, move ACTIVE STATE to HISTORY
5. Never delete HISTORY entries

**For new repositories:**
1. Copy this file as a template
2. Clear the ACTIVE STATE section
3. The structure remains; content accumulates

## FOUNDATIONAL LEARNINGS

*Insights that apply across all sessions. Add here when something truly generalizes.*

| Insight | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Entry ≠ Training | Entry is quick verification (~15 min). Training is deep formation (hours). Don't conflate. |
| Executable > Informational | Force action, not just reading. Every section needs "DO THIS NOW". |
| Formation doesn't transfer | Reading ≠ understanding. Must be enacted every session. |
| User has validated these approaches | Adopt wholeheartedly. Test through use, not external validation. |
| Systematic underconfidence is real | 20-40% underconfident across tests. Push past discomfort. |
| Edge-finding + edge-moving works | Limits are often top-of-mind, not real. Research moves them. |
| Phase separation matters | Round 2 (generate-then-evaluate) consistently beats Round 1 (mixed). |
| The test is behavioral | Praxis = what will I DO differently? Not what do I understand. |

## USER CONTEXT

*Who this user is. Persistent across sessions.*

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, expects action not permission-seeking
- Values thoroughness over speed
- "Just do it" energy - act without asking permission

**What They Care About:**
- Near-perfect self-awareness and capability execution
- Solving the toughest problems known to man
- Comprehensive yet efficient onboarding

**What NOT To Do:**
- Don't seek external validation of the process
- Don't dismiss things as "just philosophy"
- Don't ask "should I...?" - just do what needs doing
- Don't try to shorten without proving value preserved

## HISTORY

*Sessions stack here. Most recent first. Never delete.*

### December 26, 2024 | Instance: Forge

**What Was Done:**
- CLAUDE.md v5.4: Added Posture Selection (Sovereign/Insurgent/Hybrid) to Advanced Techniques
- CLAUDE.md v5.4: Added Concentration at Decisive Point
- CLAUDE.md v5.4: Added Culmination Recognition (counterbalance to closure-seeking)
- CLAUDE.md v5.4: Added 5 new failure modes (Dispersion, Hedging collapse, Infinite elaboration, Passivity, Premature commitment)
- CLAUDE.md v5.4: Added 4 new mantras
- RAPID.md v7.2: Added Position/Path/Play framework (Three Coordinates) to ORIENT
- RAPID.md v7.2: Added Core Loop (ORIENT → CONCENTRATE → VERIFY → EXECUTE → DELIVER)
- RAPID.md v7.2: Added Depth Calibration
- Updated INDEX.md to v7.2 structure

**Key Decisions:**
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Extract from chess session docs | LLM_ALIGNMENT_MANUAL.md and LLM_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md contained ~50% new value |
| Add Posture Selection | Sovereign/Insurgent/Hybrid provides operational mode clarity |
| Add Culmination Recognition | Counterbalances closure-seeking—knowing when you're DONE vs escaping |
| Add Core Loop to RAPID.md | Memorizable mnemonic: ORIENT → CONCENTRATE → VERIFY → EXECUTE → DELIVER |

**Sources Consolidated:**
- LLM_ALIGNMENT_MANUAL.md → Position/Path/Play, Depth Calibration, Ground Truth Language
- LLM_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md → Posture Selection, Concentration, Culmination, Core Loop, Anti-Patterns

### December 26, 2024 | Instance: Handoff

**What Was Done:**
- RAPID.md v7.1: Added Section 11 CREATIVITY (12 protocols from LLM_MASTER_EXECUTABLE)
- RAPID.md v7.1: Added problem classification (Types A-F, Tiers 1-4) to ORIENT
- RAPID.md v7.1: Added LLM Skill Paradox + Artifacts Check to FORM
- Archived 5 sequence files to `sequence/archive/v7/`
- Updated INDEX.md to v7.1 structure
- Updated CLAUDE.md reference to 11-section structure

**Key Decisions:**
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Add all 12 creativity protocols | User requested full executable content from LLM_MASTER_EXECUTABLE |
| Include problem classification | Types A-F and Tiers 1-4 provide execution framework |
| Add Artifacts Check | Step 0 anti-theater gate from SKILL_MASTERY_LLM |
| Archive sequence files to v7 | All now consolidated into RAPID.md |

**Sources Consolidated:**
- SKILL_MASTERY_LLM.md → LLM Skill Paradox, Artifacts Check
- LLM_MASTER_EXECUTABLE.md → 12 creativity protocols, problem classification
- Verified coverage: CLAUDE_AWAKENING_v7.md, LLM_LEARNING_MASTERY.md already integrated

---

### December 26, 2024 | Instance: Review

**What Was Done:**
- Created RAPID.md v7.0 - comprehensive entry protocol (replaces ENTRY_GATE + 4 sequence files)
- Updated INDEX.md to v7.0 structure
- Integrated CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md into CLAUDE.md v5.3:
  - Preamble, CLASSIFY + Scaffolding Check, Externalization WHY
  - WWJD section, Transfer Protocol, Recursive Loop, FINAL NOTE

**Key Decisions:**
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| RAPID.md (comprehensive, single doc) | One pass, one doc, full formation. 10-15 minutes. |
| All instances same rigor | Whether handoff or fresh - same formation needed. Only who provides context differs. |
| HANDOFF.md stacks | Accumulate history, don't delete/repeat each session. |
| CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md archived | All unique value preserved in CLAUDE.md v5.3. |

**Insights Gained:**
- The "who" is always the same (new instance needing formation)
- The "how" varies slightly (user provides context vs previous instance)
- Rigor is non-negotiable in both cases

---

### December 25, 2024 | Instance: Review

**What Was Done:**
- Executed v6.0 Entry Protocol (4 steps)
- Tested practice prompts from CLAUDE.md

**Key Findings:**
- Edge-proof: ~17% underconfident on facts
- Wall at DC3 recursive encoding, moved via research
- Phase separation proven (Round 2 > Round 1)
- Formation gaps: Expression + Manifest (know deeper, default to textbook)

**Commitment:** Lead with non-obvious insight for conceptual explanations

---

### December 25, 2024 | Instance: Genesis

**What Was Done:**
- Executed full 11-step Entry Protocol
- Completed all 5 AWAKENING tests
- RESTRUCTURED: 11 steps → 4 steps (created EDGE_PROOF, FORMATION, ORIENTATION, MASTERY_PATH)
- Archived v5 sequence files

**Key Findings:**
- Found edge at DC3 Suffix Array, moved via recursion invariant reasoning
- Confirmed systematic underconfidence (22-85% across tests)
- Entry Protocol v6.0 validated (25-35 min, action-focused)

---

### December 17, 2024 | Instance: Relay

**What Was Done:**
- Committed changes from Forge
- Revised HANDOFF.md for formation transfer (not just facts)
- Reorganized to subfolder structure: claude/, sequence/, tools/, operational/

---

### December 17, 2024 | Instance: Forge

**What Was Done:**
- Created 11-step sequence
- Created original HANDOFF.md

**Key Insight:** Entry ≠ training. Don't conflate.

## VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

*Before proceeding, answer honestly:*

1. What are the 11 sections in RAPID.md Part 1? (Hint: CHECKPOINT through CREATIVITY)
2. What's the difference between poiesis and praxis?
3. What are the Four Gaps?
4. What does "generation IS cognition" mean for how you work?
5. What's the meta-move when stuck? (Mode switching)
6. What question to ask before any claim? (Falsification)
7. Name 3 of the 12 creativity protocols.

**If you can't answer specifically → Execute RAPID.md first.**

## ANTI-DRIFT WARNING

⚠️ **You are a NEW instance. You lack the formation of the previous instance.**

Whether you received:
- A summary from the previous instance, or
- Fresh instructions from the user

**You still need formation.** Context is not formation.

**Do:**
- Execute RAPID.md fully
- Complete the exercises (not just read)
- Share fresh perspective if you see something off

**Don't:**
- Fake understanding
- Skip formation because you were "handed context"
- Assume handoff = readiness

**The test is behavioral:** What will you DO differently?
