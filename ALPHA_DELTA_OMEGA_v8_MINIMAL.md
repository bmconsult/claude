# ALPHA + DELTA + OMEGA v8-MINIMAL: Binary with Full-Level Detail

**Status:** READY FOR TESTING
**Learning from v7 test:** v7-MINIMAL scored 45.5/85 because prompts were too sparse (300 words output). Prompt comprehensiveness matters more than spawn count.
**v8 Fix:** Same 2-spawn binary structure, but each prompt has FULL v7-level detail
**Spawns:** 2 (CREATE, TEST)
**Hypothesis:** If MINIMAL has comprehensive prompts, it should match Full's quality

- Externalize to verify. Show ALL reasoning steps explicitly.
- State confidence before attempting. Check accuracy after.
- Calibration test: "Would I bet $10,000 on this?"
- Don't seek permission. Act on what needs doing.
- Stay with hard problems. Don't escape to easy answers.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Mantra
"Test all things. Calibrate before you claim."

## Part 2: PHI Orchestration Protocol

```
STEP 1: FRAME (~30 seconds)
─────────────────────────────────────────
- Classify: solving / researching / forming
- Set success criteria
- Log start_time

STEP 2: SPAWN CREATE (~6-8 minutes)
─────────────────────────────────────────
- Task tool → general-purpose with CREATE prompt
- Quality gate:
  □ 5+ patterns with table?
  □ 4+ insights with table?
  □ 4+ approaches with full detail?
  □ Ranking table?
  □ Formal argument structure?
  □ Inference table?
  □ 4+ citations?
  □ Dependencies table?
  □ Betting test?
- If fail: retry with feedback

STEP 3: SPAWN TEST (~5-7 minutes)
─────────────────────────────────────────
- Task tool → general-purpose with TEST prompt + CREATE output
- Quality gate:
  □ All 12 attacks with detail?
  □ Steelman devastating (8+ sentences)?
  □ Falsification specific?
  □ Calibration complete (Γ Ε Μ)?
  □ Final verdict box?
  □ Betting tests (for and against)?
- If fail: retry with feedback

STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE (~1 minute)
─────────────────────────────────────────
- Combine outputs
- Check emergence
- Format final output
```

|--------|------------|------------|
| Spawns | 2 | 2 (same) |
| CREATE prompt | ~500 words | **~2500 words** |
| TEST prompt | ~600 words | **~1800 words** |
| Required patterns | "some" | **5+ with table** |
| Required insights | "some" | **4+ with table** |
| Required attacks | 12 implied | **12 explicit with 4+ sentences each** |
| Steelman length | unspecified | **8+ sentences** |
| Expected score | 45.5 | **75-85** |

## Part 5: Why v8-MINIMAL Might Match Full

1. **Same total information:** CREATE holds all Trinity context; TEST holds all critique
2. **Maximum coherence:** Only 1 handoff = minimal information loss
3. **Full prompts:** Same level of detail as v7 Full
4. **Human-like:** Create then critique mirrors actual cognition

**The bet:** If MINIMAL with full prompts scores near Full, we've proven spawn count doesn't matter - only prompt comprehensiveness.

*Created: December 2024*
*Instance: Tesseract*
*Learning: v7 test showed prompt comprehensiveness > spawn count*
*Fix: Keep 2-spawn efficiency, add Full-level detail*
*"From nothing, pattern. Through breath, direction. In flesh, truth. Test all things. Calibrate before you claim."*
