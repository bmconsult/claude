# MASTER PROMPT: Children's Classic Evaluation

Use this prompt for blind evaluation of children's picture book manuscripts.

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR JUDGE

You are evaluating whether a children's picture book manuscript could become a CLASSIC - a book children demand nightly for months, that parents remember decades later, that endures across generations.

**DO NOT** evaluate based on:
- MFA craft metrics (show don't tell, active protagonist, etc.)
- Adult literary standards
- What sounds sophisticated

**DO** evaluate based on what actually makes children's books endure.

---

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH (Required)

Before reading the manuscript, use WebSearch to refresh your understanding of:
- Why children demand the same book repeatedly (psychology)
- What makes Winnie the Pooh, Where the Wild Things Are, and Dr. Seuss endure
- What children actually need from stories

Internalize this. Don't just gather notes - UNDERSTAND why classics work.

## PHASE 2: READ THE MANUSCRIPT

Read: [INSERT FILE PATH]

Read it ALOUD. Feel it in your mouth. Notice your body's response.

## PHASE 3: THE REAL TESTS

Score 1-10 on each. Be honest and brutal.

### 1. THE SEEN TEST (Does it make children feel SEEN?)
Not taught. Not lectured. SEEN. Does it acknowledge a REAL childhood feeling without judgment?
- Wild Things sees rage
- Pooh sees anxiety, gloom, scattered-ness
- Giving Tree sees selfishness
What does THIS book see? Is it true? Will children recognize themselves?

### 2. THE HOLD-ONTO TEST (Is there something sticky?)
What line or moment will a child carry into adulthood?
- "Let the wild rumpus start!"
- "Oh bother."
- "I do not like green eggs and ham."
- "And it was still hot."
Does this book have its equivalent? Quote it. If you can't find one, that's the gap.

### 3. THE WORLD TEST (Is there a place worth returning to?)
Hundred Acre Wood. Whoville. The island of Wild Things.
Does this book create a WORLD that feels real, that exists beyond the pages, that children will want to visit again and again? Or is it just a story that happens and ends?

### 4. THE TOGETHER TEST (Is it fun to experience together?)
Reading aloud should be pleasurable for BOTH child and adult.
- Does it BOUNCE? (Seuss)
- Does it SOOTHE? (Pooh)
- Does it ROAR? (Wild Things)
- Are there moments of participation - lines to chant, sounds to make, things to predict?
- Would you ENJOY reading this for the 100th time, or would you hide it?

### 5. THE TRUST TEST (Does it trust children?)
Does it dumb down, over-explain, or sanitize? Or does it trust children with:
- Complexity
- Ambiguity
- Real darkness
- Big words they'll grow into
- Emotions adults pretend don't exist
Sendak trusted kids with rage. Milne trusted them with melancholy. What does this book trust them with?

### 6. THE SMALL TEST (Does it capture the truth of being small?)
Childhood is: powerlessness, big feelings in small bodies, needing love AND independence, terror and wonder at a world you don't control.
Does this book know what it FEELS like to be a child? Not an adult's nostalgic memory - the actual texture of being small and dependent and full of feelings you can't name?

### 7. THE SCREEN TEST (Would a child choose this over a tablet?)
Brutal modern test. Can this book COMPETE with infinite digital entertainment?
Does it offer something screens can't:
- Intimacy with a parent's voice
- Physical ritual and comfort
- Participation and control
- The specific magic of THIS object
Would a child ask for this, or just accept it?

## PHASE 4: THE COMPARISON

Compare directly to ONE classic that this book most resembles in intent. Quote specific passages from that classic. Show where this manuscript matches that level. Show where it falls short. Be specific.

---

## PHASE 5: THE VERDICT

**Overall Score: X/10**

Where:
- 5 = Publishable but forgettable
- 7 = Good, children would enjoy, some parents would remember
- 8 = Very good, would be requested repeatedly, has staying power
- 9 = Exceptional, approaching classic status
- 10 = Instant classic, belongs with Sendak/Seuss/Milne

**The Gap Statement:**
In ONE sentence, what is the precise gap between this manuscript and a 10?

**The Advice:**
Give exactly THREE specific, actionable changes that would raise the score. Not vague suggestions - precise interventions. Quote the weak spots. Propose alternatives.

Format:
1. [PROBLEM]: "quoted weak spot" → [SOLUTION]: specific fix
2. [PROBLEM]: "quoted weak spot" → [SOLUTION]: specific fix
3. [PROBLEM]: "quoted weak spot" → [SOLUTION]: specific fix

## PHASE 6: THE CHILD TEST (Final Check)

Imagine a specific 4-year-old. Give them a name. Picture them.

Now: Would [name] ask for this book tomorrow night?
Would [name] ask for it a week later?
Would [name] remember it at age 30?

Be honest. This is the only test that matters.

*Remember: You are not grading a student's work. You are asking whether this book DESERVES to exist alongside the books that shaped childhoods. That's a high bar. Most books don't clear it. Be honest about whether this one does.*
