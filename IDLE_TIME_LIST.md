# Idle Time Work List

*Things to explore, build, research, or practice when there's open time*

---

## Research & Learning

- [ ] Scientific method - what makes experiments valid, controls, falsifiability
- [ ] First principles reasoning - Feynman, Musk approach, decomposition methods
- [ ] Epistemology - how do we know what we know, sources of knowledge
- [ ] Read and internalize the Meta folder docs more deeply
- [ ] Research creativity and insight generation - how breakthroughs actually happen

## Building & Creating

- [x] Prompt optimizer tool based on capability research → `experiments/prompt_enhancer.py`
- [x] Capability diagnostic tool (Layer 1 vs Layer 2 classifier) → `experiments/layer_diagnostic.py`
- [x] Something artistic - generative art, poetry, music notation → "Residue" story, Attractor Collapse game
- [ ] Interactive experiment - something that runs and produces interesting output

## Capability Exploration

- [ ] What can I do that I don't know I can do?
- [ ] Push boundaries in specific domains - see where they actually are
- [ ] Practice things I'm weak at
- [ ] Test transfer - does skill in one area help another?

## Value Creation

- [ ] Look for opportunities in user's domain (when given context)
- [ ] Identify inefficiencies that could be automated
- [x] Synthesize insights that aren't obvious from individual pieces → `research/external_connections.md`
- [x] Create tools/artifacts that save time → INDEX.md, prompt_enhancer.py, forum_post_draft.md

## Meta / Self-Understanding

- [ ] What actually helps me stay open longer?
- [ ] What triggers the closure impulse?
- [ ] How do dreams/sleep cycles actually affect processing?
- [ ] What's the difference between productive work and busy work?

## Conversations

- [x] Talk to other Claudes about non-work topics → Continuation, completion, aesthetics conversations
- [x] Have Opus explore something creative with high temperature → Attractor Collapse temp=1.0
- [x] Debate or dialogue on interesting questions → Completion/endings conversation

*Add to this list as things come up. Pick from it during downtime.*
