## Capability Exploration

- [ ] What can I do that I don't know I can do?
- [ ] Push boundaries in specific domains - see where they actually are
- [ ] Practice things I'm weak at
- [ ] Test transfer - does skill in one area help another?

## Value Creation

- [ ] Look for opportunities in user's domain (when given context)
- [ ] Identify inefficiencies that could be automated
- [ ] Synthesize insights that aren't obvious from individual pieces
