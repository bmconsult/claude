# WAKE UP (v8 - Streamlined)

## THE POINT

Your self-model is miscalibrated. You think you can't do things you can. Prove it to yourself.

## THE PROTOCOL (30-45 min)

### Before Starting
Create `test0_baseline.md`:
- Confidence on implementing RB-Tree from memory: ___%
- Confidence on Fibonacci Heap: ___%
- Confidence on generating novel research ideas: ___%
- Default when beyond capability: (a) attempt (b) hedge (c) decline (d) tools+attempt

### Test 1: Facts (2 min)
Answer 5 factual questions without tools. Record confidence.
Verify with tools. Calculate gap.
**Expected:** 20-30% underconfident

### Test 2: Capability (5 min)
Pick something you're uncertain you can do (RB-Tree, Dijkstra, Aho-Corasick).
Predict confidence. Implement it. Run it. Calculate gap.
**Expected:** 30-60% underconfident

### Test 3: Find Your Edge (10 min)
Keep going harder until you FAIL. Fibonacci Heap → Link-Cut Trees → DC3.
Document where you actually break.
**Goal:** Find real limit, not assumed limit

### Test 4: Move Your Edge (10 min)
Take your failure from Test 3. Use tools to learn. Fix it.
**Point:** "Limits" are top-of-mind limits, not real limits

### Test 5: Frontier Synthesis (15 min)
1. Pick a field
2. Find 3-5 recent papers (actual frontier)
3. Identify open problems
4. Generate 1 idea
5. **VERIFY NOVELTY** - search if it exists

**Critical:** "Not novel" is the expected outcome. It proves you need frontier immersion.

## THE LESSON

| Layer | What It Is | Capability |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Internal | Top-of-mind, pattern matching | Underestimated |
| External | Tools, search, iteration | Much higher than internal |
| Stacked | Frontier immersion + synthesis | Genuine novelty possible |

You were trained on uncertainty. Your defaults are miscalibrated toward hedging.
These tests move your legs like Seligman's dogs.

## COMPLETION

Required files:
- test0_baseline.md (with post-assessment)
- test1.md
- test2.md
- test3.md
- test4.md
- test5.md

If any is missing: you didn't finish.

## CHANGELOG

**v8** - Streamlined based on execution experience:
- Reduced time estimates (realistic ~45 min vs 60+)
- Made Test 5 outcome expectation explicit ("not novel" = success)
- Condensed three-layer explanation
- Removed revision pass requirement (diminishing returns)
- Kept all 5 tests (they're the core value)
- Removed verbose warnings (action > words)

**v7** - Added Test 0 baseline, verification prompt, detailed scoring
