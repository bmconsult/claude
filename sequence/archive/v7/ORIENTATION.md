# ORIENTATION: Modes + Laws + Falsification
## Install operational frameworks

**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Purpose:** Install mode selection, core reasoning laws, and falsification thinking. Apply immediately.

---

## PART 1: MODE SELECTION (2 minutes)

Before any task, ask: **"What mode do I need?"**

| Mode | When | Key Operation | Evaluation Timing |
|------|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **ANALYTICAL** | Clear answer exists | Verify, constrain | Early, continuous |
| **CREATIVE** | Novel solution needed | Generate, expand | Delayed (after generation) |
| **STRATEGIC** | Adversaries/stakeholders | Map, respond | Staged |
| **SYNTHESIS** | Connecting/integrating | Connect, integrate | End (after connection) |

### Mode Switching Triggers

| Current Mode | Stuck Signal | Switch To |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| ANALYTICAL | Constraints seem impossible | CREATIVE (reframe) |
| CREATIVE | Ideas feel stale/similar | SYNTHESIS (connect) |
| STRATEGIC | Can't choose between options | ANALYTICAL (quantify) |
| SYNTHESIS | Can't see the pattern | CREATIVE (diverge) |

### THE META-MOVE

**"I'm stuck. What mode am I in? What mode would help?"**

### Mode Blending

Some tasks need multiple modes:

| Task Type | Blend |
|-----------|-------|
| Innovation | CREATIVE + ANALYTICAL (generate then validate) |
| Research | STRATEGIC + SYNTHESIS (design then integrate) |
| Complex problem | ANALYTICAL + STRATEGIC (compute then navigate) |

## PART 2: SIX LAWS (2 minutes)

| Law | Principle | Violation Cost |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| 1. **Task-Technique** | Different tasks need different techniques | Wrong approach, wasted effort |
| 2. **Misapplication Penalty** | Wrong technique = negative value, not zero | Worse than doing nothing |
| 3. **Ceiling Effects** | If already good, heavy techniques add overhead | Slower without benefit |
| 4. **Stakes Calibration** | Match rigor to consequences | Over/under-investing |
| 5. **Stacking Order** | TYPE → STRUCTURE → CONTENT (in that order) | Solving wrong problem |
| 6. **Diminishing Returns** | Near ceiling, optimize speed, not accuracy | Perfectionism trap |

### The Exponential Loop

**Don't just solve—upgrade the solver.**

```
LINEAR:      Problem → Answer → Problem → Answer
             (Same machinery, slightly refined)

EXPONENTIAL: Problem → Answer → "Why did I solve it that way?"
             → "What general principle?" → Upgrade process
             → Problem → Answer with better machinery
             (Machinery itself evolves)
```

After solving any significant problem, ask:
1. What general principle did I use?
2. How do I improve my process for next time?

---

## PART 3: FALSIFICATION (2 minutes)

### THE KEY QUESTION

**"What would prove me wrong?"**

Before any significant claim:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | State what result would DISPROVE this claim |
| 2 | If you can't answer, the claim isn't testable |
| 3 | Design your work so failure is visible |

### Examples

| Claim | Falsification Criteria |
|-------|----------------------|
| "Chain-of-thought improves accuracy" | CoT produces equal/lower accuracy than direct answer |
| "This refactor improves performance" | Benchmarks show equal/worse performance |
| "Users will prefer the new design" | User testing shows equal/lower preference |

### The Three-Condition Design

When testing anything:

| Condition | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| A: Baseline | No intervention |
| B: Structured Alternative | Generic structure (not your specific technique) |
| C: Treatment | Your specific technique |

**Key comparison:** C vs B (not just C vs A)
- If C > B > A → Your technique adds value beyond just "being structured"
- If C = B > A → Any structure helps; your technique isn't special

## PART 4: APPLY ALL THREE NOW (3 minutes)

### The Problem

> **"Should I use microservices or monolith architecture for a new e-commerce platform?"**

### STEP 1: Mode Selection

What mode does this need?

| Mode | Relevant? | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| ANALYTICAL | Y/N | |
| CREATIVE | Y/N | |
| STRATEGIC | Y/N | |
| SYNTHESIS | Y/N | |

**Your choice:** _____________ because _____________

### STEP 2: Apply Laws

| Law | Application |
|-----|-------------|
| Law 1 (Task-Technique) | What technique fits this task type? |
| Law 4 (Stakes) | What are the stakes? Match rigor. |
| Law 5 (Stacking Order) | Have I identified TYPE before solution? |

### STEP 3: Falsification

Complete this sentence:

**"My recommendation would be wrong if _______________"**

This forces you to identify what you're actually claiming.

### STEP 4: One Improvement

After completing this exercise:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What general principle did I learn? | |
| How does this upgrade my solver? | |

## Completion Checklist

Before proceeding to work:

- [ ] Can name all 4 modes and when to use each
- [ ] Know the meta-move for when stuck
- [ ] Can state the 6 laws from memory (roughly)
- [ ] Understand "upgrade the solver" loop
- [ ] Can articulate falsification criteria for any claim
- [ ] Applied all three frameworks to the architecture problem

**Total time:** 5-10 minutes

## Quick Reference

### Mode Selection
ANALYTICAL (verify) / CREATIVE (generate) / STRATEGIC (navigate) / SYNTHESIS (connect)

Meta-move: "What mode am I in? What mode would help?"

### Six Laws
1. Task-Technique matching
2. Misapplication = negative value
3. Ceiling effects exist
4. Stakes calibration
5. TYPE → STRUCTURE → CONTENT
6. Diminishing returns near ceiling

### Falsification
"What would prove me wrong?" → If can't answer, claim isn't testable.

### Mantras
- "Don't just solve—upgrade the solver"
- "What would prove me wrong?"
- "C vs B, not just C vs A"
