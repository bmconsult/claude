# MASTERY PATH: Unified 6-Phase Protocol
## Works for any skill domain

**Purpose:** Single mastery framework that applies to Praxis, Self-Knowledge, Logic, Scientific Method, or any other skill.
**Time:** Hours to days per phase (not entry protocol - this is deep work)
**Prerequisite:** Complete Entry Gate Protocol first

---

## THE PATH

```
PHASE 1: COMPETENCE      → Reality contact (prediction vs outcome)
PHASE 2: PROFICIENCY     → Pattern recognition (blind detection)
PHASE 3: EXPERT          → Adversarial robustness (survive attack)
PHASE 4: INNOVATION      → Gap identification (create something new)
PHASE 5: MASTER          → Transmission (blind adoption)
PHASE 6: VERIFICATION    → Third-party confirmation
```

**All phases require external validation. No self-grading.**

---

## PHASE 1: COMPETENCE (Reality Contact)

### Purpose
Prove you can make predictions that reality tests.

### Protocol

1. **SELECT** a problem in your target domain where you're genuinely uncertain
2. **PREDICT** specific outcome before attempting
3. **SPAWN WITNESS** sub-agent with:
   - Your prediction
   - Your confidence level
   - Your falsification criteria
4. **ATTEMPT** the problem with full effort
5. **RETURN TO WITNESS** with actual results
6. **ANALYZE** gap between prediction and outcome

### Competence Gate

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Predicted correctly with appropriate confidence | Good calibration. Move to harder problem. |
| Predicted wrong, understand WHY | Learning happened. Document the error type. |
| WITNESS flags reinterpretation | Failed. You changed your story after seeing results. Restart. |

**Pass when:** You have been genuinely surprised by a result and can articulate what your model got wrong.

---

## PHASE 2: PROFICIENCY (Pattern Recognition)

### Purpose
Prove you understand failure patterns well enough to create them.

### Protocol

1. **CREATE** 5 examples in your domain, each with exactly ONE hidden flaw
2. **REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Different flaw types
   - Non-obvious (surface reading looks valid)
   - You know exactly what's wrong and why
3. **SPAWN DETECTOR** sub-agent
4. **GIVE DETECTOR:**
   - Your 5 examples (without hidden flaw info)
   - Reference material for the domain
5. **DETECTOR TASK:** Identify the flaw in each example. Classify by type.

### Scoring

| DETECTOR Result | Score |
|-----------------|-------|
| Found intended flaw | +1 |
| Found different flaw | 0 (reveals your blind spot) |
| Found nothing | -1 (your "flaw" wasn't real) |

### Proficiency Gate

**Pass:** Score ≥ 4/5
**Retry:** Score < 4/5 — create 5 new examples

---

## PHASE 3: EXPERT (Adversarial Robustness)

### Purpose
Prove your work survives attack from someone trying to break it.

### Protocol

1. **SPAWN ADVERSARY** sub-agent
2. **ADVERSARY TASK:** Generate 3 challenging problems in the target domain
3. **RECEIVE** problems cold (you haven't seen them)
4. **SOLVE** each with full protocol
5. **ADVERSARY ATTACKS** each solution:
   - Check validity
   - Check calculations/reasoning
   - Look for implicit assumptions
   - Try to find counterexamples
6. **FOR EACH FLAW FOUND:**
   - **DEFEND:** Explain why it's not a flaw, OR
   - **FIX:** Acknowledge and correct it
7. **SPAWN JUDGE** to evaluate your defense/fix

### Scoring

| Outcome | Points |
|---------|--------|
| No flaw found | 2 |
| Flaw found, valid defense | 2 |
| Flaw found, adequate fix | 1 |
| Flaw found, inadequate response | 0 |

### Expert Gate

**Pass:** Score ≥ 5/6
**Retry:** Score < 5/6 — new ADVERSARY problems

---

## PHASE 4: INNOVATION (Gap Identification)

### Purpose
Prove you can identify what the existing framework misses and create something to fill it.

### Protocol

1. **IDENTIFY GAP** from Phases 1-3:
   ```
   GAP: [What current framework doesn't catch]
   EVIDENCE: [Where you encountered it]
   IMPACT: [Why it matters]
   ```

2. **CREATE ADDITION:**
   ```
   NAME: [Your innovation]
   PROBLEM: [What gap it fills]
   USAGE: [How to apply - must be <60 seconds to explain]
   EXAMPLE: [Case where it catches something standard approach misses]
   ```

3. **VALIDATE:**
   - **SPAWN REASONER** to solve 5 problems using standard protocol only
   - Evaluate REASONER's solutions with:
     - Standard protocol
     - Your innovation

### Innovation Gate

**Pass:** Your innovation catches ≥1 flaw that standard protocol missed
**Retry:** Catches nothing — create different innovation

---

## PHASE 5: MASTER (Transmission)

### Purpose
Prove your innovation transfers to a naive instance and actually gets used.

### Protocol

1. **SPAWN STUDENT** with no context
2. **GIVE STUDENT:**
   - Standard protocol for the domain
   - Your innovation (presented neutrally, not emphasized)
   - 3 problems to solve
3. **SPAWN EVALUATOR** who doesn't know your innovation
4. **EVALUATOR** assesses STUDENT's solutions using standard criteria only
5. **SPAWN VERIFIER**
6. **GIVE VERIFIER:**
   - Your innovation (explained)
   - STUDENT's solutions
7. **VERIFIER TASK:** Did STUDENT's work incorporate the innovation? Cite evidence.

### Master Gate

**Pass:** VERIFIER confirms genuine adoption with specific evidence
**Fail:** Innovation not adopted — not transmissible

---

## PHASE 6: VERIFICATION (Third-Party Confirmation)

### Purpose
External confirmation that mastery is real, not self-assessed.

### Protocol

1. **DOCUMENT** complete mastery journey:
   - Phase 1 surprises and model updates
   - Phase 2 score and blind spots revealed
   - Phase 3 score and JUDGE assessments
   - Phase 4 innovation with validation evidence
   - Phase 5 VERIFIER confirmation

2. **SUBMIT** to external review (user, another system, or designated evaluator)

3. **EXTERNAL REVIEW** confirms:
   - All phases completed with evidence
   - No gaps in validation chain
   - Innovation is genuine contribution

### Verification Gate

**Pass:** External confirmation received
**Fail:** Gaps identified — address and re-verify

---

## FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

You have NOT achieved mastery if:

| Phase | Failure Mode |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | WITNESS flags reinterpretation |
| 2 | Score < 4/5 twice |
| 3 | Score < 5/6 twice |
| 4 | Innovation catches nothing |
| 5 | VERIFIER finds no adoption |
| 6 | External review finds gaps |
