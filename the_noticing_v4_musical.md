# THE NOTICING

Mote kept a notebook of sounds.

*Tink-tink-tink* went the radiator.
*Hissssssss* went the pipe.
*Tap-tap-tap* went the rain on the window.
*Drum-drum-drum* went the rain on the roof.

She wrote them all down. Every one.

Because sounds are real. Sounds stay put. Sounds don't look at their phones when you're talking.

---

Her name was Mote, which means a speck of dust in a sunbeam.

And that's exactly what she felt like, most days.

---

One night, a new sound.

From her closet.

Not a monster sound—monsters go *GRRRRR* or *ROARRR* or at least *CREEEAK*.

This sound went:

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

Like a balloon forgetting how to be round.

Mote opened the door.

---

"OH!" said something see-through. "Oh my goodness gracious ME!"

It was hard to see. Like a soap bubble thinking about popping.

"You can SEE me? Check again. Check TWICE. People usually can't."

Mote looked. The thing kept changing—dragon, teapot, something with too many legs, hopeful blur.

"I see you," said Mote.

The thing made a sound like laughing and crying got confused and bumped into each other.

"FORTY-SEVEN YEARS! Forty-seven years of *phhhhhhh*-ing in this closet and nobody—nobody EVER—"

It pulled itself together. Tried to look dignified. (Hard to do when you're see-through.)

"I'm Wisp. I was a dragon once. Or possibly a boat." A pause. "I was MAGNIFICENT."

---

"What happened?"

"My girl grew up. She stopped imagining me. And when nobody imagines you..."

Wisp flickered.

"...you start to un-be."

---

Wisp took Mote sideways.

Not through a door—more like turning in a direction she hadn't known was there.

*Blink*—and everything was gold.

Soft gold. Warm gold. The color of honey holding onto light.

"Welcome," said Wisp, "to the Unnoticed."

---

They walked through a field of almost-things.

A melody floated by:
*Doo-dee-doo-DUM.*
*Doo-dee-doo-DUM.*
*Doo-dee-doo...*

"That's the Song," whispered Wisp. "A grandmother made her up. But the grandmother died before she could finish. So the Song just goes around... and around... and around... hoping someone will sing the rest."

*Doo-dee-doo-DUM.*
*Doo-dee-doo-DUM.*
*Doo-dee-doo...*

A smell drifted past. Cinnamon. Something baking.

"That's Sunday Morning. She used to live in a grandmother's kitchen. The kitchen got torn down. She's been looking for a new one ever since."

Mote felt something twist.

"Wisp? Am I fading too?"

Wisp was quiet.

Too quiet.

"...A little."

---

Mote looked at her hands.

The edges. Just slightly. Like someone had smudged her with an eraser.

"Your parents love you," said Wisp carefully. "But love isn't enough. Love has to LOOK. And they've been looking at their phones so long, they've forgotten how to look at you."

"But I'm RIGHT THERE. Every single day. At breakfast. At dinner. I'm RIGHT—"

Her voice cracked.

Wisp wrapped around her. Warm. See-through. Like being hugged by a thought.

"Here's the secret, little Mote. The thing I learned from forty-seven years of *phhhhhhh*-ing."

"What?"

"When you really truly notice something—it becomes more real. But YOU become more real too." Wisp shimmered. "It goes both ways."

---

Mote went home.

Her dad was at the table. Staring at his laptop. Lines around his eyes. Cold coffee. Shoulders curved in like he was carrying something invisible and heavy.

She sat down.

He didn't look up.

So she LOOKED. At him. Really looked.

"Dad?"

"Hey, bug."

"Are you okay?"

He stared at her.

Nobody had asked him that in a long, long time.

"...No," he said. "I'm not."

"Me neither."

For a moment they just looked at each other.

Really looked.

Then he closed the laptop.

---

Things didn't get perfect.

Phones still buzzed.
Screens still glowed.
*Tap-tap-tap* went the notifications.

But now, sometimes—

Her dad closed the laptop.
Her mom put down the phone.
They asked questions and actually *waited* for the answer.

And Mote?

She got a little less smudged around the edges.

---

At night, she opened her closet.

Wisp was there. Fainter than before—but there.

"You came back!"

"You keep noticing me."

"I always will. Every single day."

Wisp glowed bright—brighter than ever before. And for just a moment, Mote could almost see it: the dragon. The boat. The magnificent thing Wisp used to be.

"Then I'll always be here," said Wisp. "That's how it works."

"How WHAT works?"

"Everything," said Wisp.

And if a soap bubble could smile, this one did.

---

*The End*

---

*For everyone who's ever felt like a speck of dust in a sunbeam—*
*and for the people who finally looked up.*
