# THE NOTICING

Mote found Wisp in her closet on a Tuesday.

"What ARE you?" she asked.

"I was a dragon," said Wisp. "Or possibly a boat. I was very good at it, whatever it was."

Wisp was see-through. Like a soap bubble. Like a dream you're forgetting.

"What happened?"

"My girl grew up. She stopped imagining me. So I started... un-being."

Mote reached out. Her hand went right through.

"That tickles," said Wisp.

"Sorry."

"Don't be. That's the most anyone's touched me in years."

---

Wisp took Mote to where forgotten things go.

There was a Song that only knew four notes. *Hum-hum-hum-hummm.* It kept hoping someone would remember the rest.

There was a Word named Petrichor—very tall, very proud—who used to mean "the smell of rain on dry ground" but nobody said him anymore.

There was a Smell like cinnamon and something baking, wandering around, looking for a kitchen to belong to.

"It's not so bad here," said Wisp. "Bit quiet. Bit pale. But peaceful."

"It's sad," said Mote.

"Only if you think about it."

"I always think about it. I notice everything."

Wisp flickered. "Yes. That's why you can see us. Most people are too busy."

---

Mote looked at her own hands. They seemed... blurry. At the edges.

"Am I fading too?"

Wisp was quiet. Then: "A little."

"Because nobody notices ME?"

"Your parents love you. They're just... looking at their phones."

Mote sat down. "How do I un-fade?"

"I don't know. I've never seen anyone come back." Wisp drifted closer. "But I've also never met anyone who could see us. Maybe you're different."

"Maybe."

"There's one thing I've learned, being mostly-not-here."

"What?"

"Noticing things—really seeing them—it makes them more real." Wisp shimmered. "But it also makes YOU more real. It goes both ways."

---

Mote went home.

Her dad was at the table, staring at his laptop. He looked tired. Not busy-tired. Scared-tired.

She sat across from him.

He didn't look up.

So she looked at HIM. Really looked. The lines around his eyes. The cold coffee. The way his shoulders hunched like he was carrying something heavy.

"Dad?"

He glanced up. "Hey, bug."

"Are you okay?"

He blinked. Nobody had asked him that in a while.

"...No," he said. "Not really."

"Me neither."

For a long moment, they just looked at each other.

Then he closed the laptop.

---

Things didn't get perfect. Phones still buzzed. Screens still glowed.

But something was different.

Mote noticed her parents.

And they started noticing her back.

And everyone got a little more real.

---

In her closet, Wisp waited. Faint as moonlight. Patient as dust.

Mote opened the door.

"You're still here!"

"You keep noticing me."

"I always will."

Wisp glowed—just for a moment—bright as a dragon. Or maybe a boat.

"I know," said Wisp. "That's what makes it true."

*The End*
