# THE NOTICING
### A Picture Book

---

[Spread 1: Mote in her room, labeling things with sticky notes]

Mote gave names to everything.

The radiator was Mr. Hiss.
The third stair was Old Groan.
The sound the wind makes? Whisper-Miss.

---

[Spread 2: Parents on devices, Mote small in corner]

But nobody noticed Mote.

*I notice you,* she thought.
*Why don't you notice me?*

---

[Spread 3: Closet door, something glowing inside]

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

---

[Spread 4: Wisp revealed - shifting, see-through, magnificent]

"I was a dragon once.
I was a boat.
I was MAGNIFICENT.

But my girl forgot me."

*I notice you,* said Mote.

And Wisp began to glow.

---

[Spread 5: Turning sideways into gold]

"Come see where the forgotten go."

---

[Spread 6-7: THE UNNOTICED - gold field, half-visible things drifting]

Songs no one finished.
Smells from kitchens long gone.
Words no one says anymore.

---

[Spread 8: Mote reaching toward the forgotten things]

*I notice you.*

---

[Spread 9-10-11: THE RUMPUS - wordless spreads]

[9: Mote spinning, things starting to glow around her]

[10: Everything BLAZING - songs becoming visible, smells becoming colors, Wisp huge and dragon-shaped]

[11: Mote laughing, arms wide, surrounded by light]

---

[Spread 12: Stillness returning, Wisp fading]

"I have to go home now."

"Will you forget me?"

*I notice you. I'll always notice you.*

---

[Spread 13: Home. Father at table. Phone glowing. Coffee cold.]

---

[Spread 14: Mote sits across from him]

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He looked up.

No one had asked in a long, long time.

"...No."

"Me neither."

---

[Spread 15: The laptop closes. Their eyes meet.]

*I notice you.*

---

[Spread 16: Night. Closet door open. Wisp glowing bright.]

"You came back."

"You keep noticing me."

*I always will.*

---

[Final spread: Mote asleep, Wisp wrapped around her like light, both glowing]

---

*The End*

---

*For the ones who name the radiator—*
*and the ones who finally look up.*
