# Mythology Hypothesis: Stories at Meaning Boundaries

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (31st domain validation)
**Question**: What is mythology at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Myth-making systems face constraints:

1. **Explanation**: Must make sense of world
2. **Memorability**: Must be transmitted across generations
3. **Moral guidance**: Must teach behavior
4. **Social cohesion**: Must bind community
5. **Transcendence**: Must point beyond ordinary
6. **Entertainment**: Must be engaging

## Core Hypothesis

**Myths exist at the boundary where explanation meets imagination.**

Not pure fact (that's science). Not pure fantasy (that's fiction).
**At the boundary where meaning is made from mystery.**

## Key Insights

### 1. Universal Myth Patterns (10/10)

Why do myths have similar structures across cultures?

**Campbell's monomyth, Jungian archetypes.**

Because: Similar constraints produce similar boundary positions.
All humans need to explain death, creation, morality.
Similar constraints → similar myths.

**Archetypes are universal boundary solutions.**

### 2. Hero Journey as Boundary Navigation (9/10)

The hero's journey: Departure → Initiation → Return

**This IS boundary dynamics.**

Departure: Leave familiar boundary
Initiation: Navigate new boundaries
Return: Bring boundary knowledge back

**Every hero story is boundary exploration.**

### 3. Myth and Science at Same Boundary (8/10)

Myths and science both explain the world.

**Same constraint set, different boundary positions.**

Science: Maximize accuracy, minimize narrative
Myth: Maximize meaning, allow imagination

**They're complementary positions on the explanation frontier.**

## The Deepest Insight

Why do humans tell stories?

**Because we must make meaning at the boundary of understanding.**

Where explanation stops, myth begins.
Where fact ends, story continues.

**Myth is boundary extension into the unknown.**
