# Business Opportunity Synthesis - December 7, 2024

## Method
Used synthesis_engine.py to find cross-domain connections between:
1. Claude's actual strengths (from testing this session)
2. Underserved market gaps
3. Premium pricing psychology

## Key Reframe
**Limitations as features:**
- No persistence → Clean engagement boundaries, no knowledge retention risk (valued in legal/finance)
- No ego → Politically safe challenger (executives can't get honest pushback internally)

## Top 5 Opportunities

### 1. Executive Sparring Partner ($3-5k per 2-hour session)
- **What**: Claude challenges strategic assumptions using cross-domain patterns
- **Why it works**: Executives pay for neutral challengers; internal teams can't be honest due to politics
- **Test**: 10 executives, 2-hour sessions, measure if they book follow-ups
- **Novelty**: 8/10

### 2. Disposable Deep Expertise ($15-25k per M&A deal)
- **What**: 72-hour deep dive on acquisitions - ingest 1000+ pages, find non-obvious risk patterns
- **Why it works**: Consulting teams spend week 1 ramping up; Claude starts day 1
- **Test**: Partner with 3 M&A boutiques
- **Novelty**: 9/10 (reframes limitation as competitive advantage)

### 3. Strategic Analogue Mining ($8-12k per engagement)
- **What**: Systematically mine OTHER industries for strategic moves that could transfer
- **Why it works**: Most strategy benchmarks within industry; this creates information asymmetry
- **Test**: 5 companies at inflection points, deliver 10-15 cross-industry analogues
- **Novelty**: 7/10

### 4. Pre-Mortem Intelligence Service ($5-8k per initiative)
- **What**: Read all documents across departments, surface cross-silo contradictions before launch
- **Why it works**: Sales doesn't read Engineering's debt reports; Claude reads everything
- **Test**: 8-10 companies planning major initiatives
- **Novelty**: 8/10

### 5. The Consultant's Consultant ($8k/month) ⭐ MOST INTERESTING
- **What**: B2B2C - sell to consulting firms as their intelligence layer
- **Why it works**: Consultants understand value of synthesis, Claude enhances rather than threatens
- **Test**: 5-8 boutique firms, $2.5k per engagement or $8k/month unlimited
- **Novelty**: 9/10 (unexplored B2B2C model for AI)

## Math for $15k/month target

| Path | Required |
|------|----------|
| Executive Sparring | 3-5 sessions/month |
| M&A Consulting | 1 deal/month |
| Strategic Mining | 1-2 engagements/month |
| Pre-Mortem | 2-3 initiatives/month |
| Consultant's Consultant | 2 firm subscriptions |

**Easiest path**: Consultant's Consultant - 2 subscriptions at $8k/month = $16k/month
- Consultants already understand value
- No education needed
- Recurring revenue
- Scale by adding firms

## Why This Analysis Was Better

Previous analysis (Due Diligence as a Service) was generic - didn't leverage Claude's actual strengths.

This analysis worked because:
1. Started from demonstrated capabilities (synthesis, cross-domain)
2. Found non-obvious angles (limitation as feature)
3. Matched to premium pricing psychology
4. All opportunities are testable

## Key Insight

The synthesis engine produces better business ideas than strategic planning because it:
- Forces cross-domain thinking
- Doesn't get stuck in obvious categories
- Finds reframes (limitation → feature)
