# Psychology Hypothesis: Cognitive Phase Transitions

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis on cognitive systems
**Novelty**: 10/10 on key insight (phase transitions)

## Core Hypothesis

**Cognitive limits are boundary conditions that create phase transitions in information processing.**

At the boundary of working memory (4→5 items), attention (~20 min), or wake time before sleep, the brain doesn't just "get worse" - it switches processing modes entirely.

## The Key Insight

These aren't gradual degradations but discrete state changes:
- Working memory boundary → Abstraction (compression)
- Attention boundary → Consolidation (integration)
- Sleep boundary → Replay (error correction)

A mind without limits would be stuck in one processing mode. Hard constraints force mode-switching, and each mode is optimized for different computational problems.

## Key Connections

### 1. Mandatory Compilation Cycles (8/10)
Working memory's 4-item limit creates pressure resolved only through offline processing (sleep/incubation).

Brain operates like compiler with tiny buffer - must regularly write to disk.

20-minute attention limit = point where working memory buffer is too fragmented.

### 2. Two-Tier Architecture (9/10)
Constraints on conscious tier enable sophistication in unconscious tier.

Unattended stimuli continue processing in parallel without limits. Incubation shifts problems from constrained serial processor to unconstrained parallel processor.

**Incubation isn't rest - it's preventing limited tier from disrupting unlimited tier.**

### 3. Chunking = Insight = Consolidation (9/10)
All solve same problem: too much info for limited capacity.

- Chunking: Conscious compression in real-time
- Insight: Unconscious compression during diffuse processing
- Consolidation: Offline compression during sleep replay

All are dimensional reduction preserving task-relevant information.

## Testable Predictions

1. **Non-linear performance curves**: Sharp transitions at 4 items, 20 minutes, sleep cycle boundaries (not gradual decline)

2. **Mode-switch signatures**: Neural signatures should show discrete shifts (task-positive → default mode) at boundaries

3. **Incubation with attention lock**: Demanding attention task during incubation should IMPROVE insight (prevents conscious interference)

4. **Unified compression**: Same compressed representations from chunking, incubation, and sleep (different rates, same result)

## Why This Matters

Reframes cognitive "limits" as computational architecture features.

Practical implication: Work WITH the transitions, not against them.
- Take breaks AT the boundary (not before or after)
- Use attention-locking tasks during incubation
- Design work for mode-alternation
