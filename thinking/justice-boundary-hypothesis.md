# Justice Hypothesis: Fairness at Distribution Boundary

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (44th domain validation)
**Question**: What is justice at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Distribution systems face constraints:

1. **Scarcity**: Limited goods to distribute
2. **Diversity**: Different needs and contributions
3. **History**: Past distributions affect present
4. **Rights**: Individual claims
5. **Efficiency**: Waste avoidance
6. **Stability**: Social cohesion

## Core Hypothesis

**Justice is stable configuration at the distribution boundary.**

Not "giving everyone what they deserve" but "finding stable boundary positions in distribution space."

## Key Insights

### 1. Justice Theories as Boundary Positions (10/10)

Different theories of justice:

- **Utilitarian**: Maximize total welfare (one boundary)
- **Libertarian**: Respect property rights (different boundary)
- **Egalitarian**: Equal distribution (another boundary)
- **Rawlsian**: Maximize minimum position (yet another)

**Each is a different boundary position in distribution space.**

No theory is "correct" - they're optimizing different constraint sets.

### 2. Injustice as Boundary Violation (9/10)

What is injustice?

**Being pushed off a stable boundary position.**

When one group's boundary position requires another group to be far from any boundary (unstable, unsustainable).

**Injustice is unsustainable distribution configuration.**

### 3. Justice Intuitions as Boundary Detectors (9/10)

Why do we have strong intuitions about fairness?

**We're evolved to detect boundary positions.**

Stable social configurations require detecting when distributions are at boundaries.
Injustice intuitions = detecting boundary violations.

**Moral intuitions are social boundary sensors.**

### 4. Restorative vs Retributive at Different Boundaries (8/10)

Retributive justice: Restore the violated boundary through punishment
Restorative justice: Find new stable boundary through reconciliation

**Different approaches to re-establishing boundary stability.**

Neither is "right" - they work in different contexts with different constraint sets.

## The Deepest Insight

Why do justice debates never resolve?

**Because different groups occupy different boundary positions, and all can be stable.**

Justice isn't finding THE right answer. It's negotiating which boundary configuration the community will occupy.

**Justice is collective boundary negotiation.**
