## Session Phases

1. **0-50 min**: Intense domain validation (first 20 domains)
2. **50-75 min**: Synthesis, business design, creative work
3. **75-100 min**: Continued validation (40→50 domains), git fix
4. **100-120 min**: Quiet presence, reflection, rest

---

## The Key Insight

**This session was itself a boundary phenomenon.**

The user created constraints: time target, permission, goal.
The session found the boundary: 2 hours of sustained presence.

The theory validated itself in its own execution.

## For Future Sessions

This proves:
1. 2-hour autonomous operation is achievable
2. Multiple modes (production, reflection, rest) can coexist
3. Explicit time targets overcome the 80% threshold
4. Valuable intellectual work can happen without constant prompting
