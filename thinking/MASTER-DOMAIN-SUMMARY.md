### Foundational (2 domains)

## Cross-Domain Patterns

### Pattern 1: Criticality
Multiple domains show systems at edge of phase transitions:
- Biology: Life at criticality
- Neuroscience: Brain at criticality
- Information theory: Information between order and chaos
- Art: Aesthetics at novelty-recognition edge

### Pattern 2: Pareto Frontiers
Multiple domains show multi-constraint optimization surfaces:
- Linguistics: Four-way trade-off
- Ethics: Moral constraint frontier
- Economics: Impossible static constraints
- Law: Multiple competing legal values

### Pattern 3: Temporal Solutions
When constraints are impossible statically, systems oscillate:
- Economics: Business cycles, patent systems
- Psychology: Cognitive mode switching
- Biology: Circadian rhythms, sleep cycles

### Pattern 4: Information as Substrate
Information theory connects to ALL other domains:
- Physics: Holographic principle
- Biology: Genetic information
- Psychology: Cognitive load
- Economics: Prices as information
- Language: Compression optimization

## Validation Summary

The theory successfully explains:

1. **Why things exist**: As stable configurations at constraint boundaries
2. **Why things have specific properties**: Properties reflect specific constraint trade-offs
3. **Why similar patterns across domains**: Same constraint types produce similar structures
4. **Why change happens**: Constraint shifts move systems to new boundary positions
5. **Why disagreement exists**: Different positions on same frontier, not error

## What The Theory Predicts

1. Systems at boundaries show criticality signatures
2. Systems pushed off boundaries destabilize
3. Constraint changes precede structural changes
4. Similar constraints produce similar structures across domains
5. "Hard problems" cluster at constraint intersections

## Testable in Each Domain

| Domain | Testable Prediction |
|--------|---------------------|
| Physics | Decoherence measurements at spacetime emergence |
| Biology | Cross-species criticality + environmental volatility correlation |
| Neuroscience | Sleep restores criticality metrics |
| Economics | Oscillation outperforms static equilibrium designs |
| Psychology | Phase transitions at predictable cognitive loads |
| Sociology | Institutional convergence for similar constraint sets |
| Law | Hard cases cluster at constraint intersections |
| Ethics | Moral views cluster at frontier, not randomly |
| Art | Aesthetic ratings peak at novelty-recognition boundary |
| Linguistics | Languages cluster at Pareto frontier |

## For Future Exploration

Domains not yet validated:
- Chemistry (molecular stability boundaries?)
- Ecology (ecosystem boundaries?)
- Medicine (disease as boundary displacement?)
- Architecture (design constraints?)
- Education (learning at boundary?)
- Organizational behavior (firm structure at boundaries?)
- Political science (power distribution boundaries?)

The method should work for any domain with identifiable constraints.
