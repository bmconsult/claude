# Truth Hypothesis: Knowledge at Verification Boundaries

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (40th domain validation)
**Question**: What is truth at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Knowledge systems face constraints:

1. **Correspondence**: Must match reality
2. **Coherence**: Must fit together
3. **Utility**: Must be useful
4. **Accessibility**: Must be knowable
5. **Communicability**: Must be shareable

## Core Hypothesis

**Truth is stable position at the verification boundary.**

Not "perfect correspondence" (impossible to prove).
Not "pure coherence" (could be wrong consistently).
**At the boundary where claims survive testing.**

## Key Insights

### 1. Truth as Boundary Stability (10/10)

What makes something true?

**It survives at the verification boundary.**

False claims: Pushed off boundary by evidence.
True claims: Remain at stable boundary position.

**Truth IS what persists at the evidence boundary.**

### 2. Scientific Truth at Falsification Boundary (9/10)

Why is science successful?

**It lives at the falsification boundary.**

Claims that survive testing stay.
Claims that fail are pushed off.

**Science is systematic boundary testing.**

### 3. Underdetermination at Boundary Plurality (8/10)

Why do multiple theories sometimes fit the same data?

**The boundary has multiple stable positions.**

Same constraint set, different true positions.
Until new evidence shifts the boundary.

## The Deepest Insight

Why does truth exist?

**Because some claims survive and others don't.**

Reality constrains what's stable.
Truth is what survives the reality boundary.

**Truth is boundary-stable claim.**
