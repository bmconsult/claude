# Time Hypothesis: Temporality at Process Boundaries

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (34th domain validation)
**Question**: What is time at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Time-bound systems face constraints:

1. **Entropy**: Disorder increases
2. **Causality**: Effects follow causes
3. **Memory**: Past persists in present
4. **Anticipation**: Future affects present
5. **Change**: Things must differ across moments

## Core Hypothesis

**Time is what it feels like to be at the entropy boundary.**

Not fundamental (maybe). But experientially real.
**Time is boundary experience.**

## Key Insights

### 1. Arrow of Time as Boundary Direction (10/10)

Why does time have a direction?

**Because entropy defines a boundary direction.**

Past: Lower entropy states
Future: Higher entropy states
Present: AT the boundary between them

**We experience the boundary as "now."**

### 2. Memory as Past Boundary Trace (9/10)

What is memory?

**Persistence of past boundary positions.**

Each moment: At boundary
Memory: Record of where boundary was
**Memory is boundary history.**

### 3. Anticipation as Future Boundary Modeling (9/10)

What is anticipation?

**Prediction of future boundary positions.**

We model where the boundary will move.
Planning is boundary extrapolation.

## The Deepest Insight

Why does time exist?

**Because change happens at boundaries.**

Without boundaries, no distinction between states.
Without distinction, no time.

**Time IS boundary process.**
