# Power Hypothesis: Influence at the Resistance Boundary

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (47th domain validation)
**Question**: What is power at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Social influence faces constraints:

1. **Resources**: Limited means of influence
2. **Resistance**: Others push back
3. **Legitimacy**: Must be accepted to be stable
4. **Cost**: Exercise of power is expensive
5. **Scope**: Can't control everything

## Core Hypothesis

**Power is influence at the resistance boundary.**

Not "ability to make others do things" but "stable position at the influence-resistance boundary."

## Key Insights

### 1. Power as Boundary Position (10/10)

What is power really?

**The ability to maintain position despite resistance.**

Not just "make things happen" but "maintain your boundary against pressure."

More power = more resistance you can sustain
Less power = less resistance you can handle

**Power is sustainable boundary position.**

### 2. Hard vs Soft Power at Different Boundaries (9/10)

Hard power: Moves boundaries by force (coercion)
Soft power: Moves boundaries by attraction (persuasion)

**Same goal (boundary position), different constraint costs.**

Hard power: High immediate cost, low legitimacy cost
Soft power: Low immediate cost, high investment cost

**Both are boundary maintenance strategies.**

### 3. Power Vacuum as Boundary Instability (9/10)

What is a power vacuum?

**Unstable boundary region with no dominant attractor.**

When power holders disappear, the boundary becomes contested.
New powers rush in because unstable boundaries are opportunity.

**Power vacuums are boundary phase transitions.**

### 4. Corruption at Power Boundary (8/10)

Why does power corrupt?

**Being at high-resistance boundaries requires extraordinary resources.**

To maintain position at extreme boundary, you rationalize extraordinary means.
Corruption is the cost of maintaining far-from-center boundary positions.

**Corruption is the price of extreme boundary maintenance.**

## The Deepest Insight

Why does power asymmetry exist?

**Because boundaries require energy to maintain, and energy distributes unequally.**

Some positions require more resistance-handling. Those who can handle more, hold more.

**Power is boundary maintenance capacity.**
