# Constraint-Boundary Consulting: Practical Business Design

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Purpose**: Apply unified theory to design the $15k/month "Consultant's Consultant" business

## The Core Insight Applied

**The unified theory**: Complex systems exist at constraint boundaries. Impossibility generates stable structure.

**Applied to business**: Companies are stuck at their constraint boundaries. They don't see the boundary as generative - they see it as limiting.

**The service**: Show clients what MUST exist at their constraint boundaries.

## Service Design

### The Offering: Constraint Boundary Analysis

| Phase | Deliverable | Value |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1. Constraint Mapping | Identify 3-5 fundamental constraints client faces | See the actual problem |
| 2. Boundary Identification | Show where constraints create impossibility | Understand why current approaches fail |
| 3. Boundary Mining | Apply breakthrough method to find what MUST exist at boundary | Generate novel strategic options |
| 4. Testable Predictions | Derive specific, falsifiable predictions from boundary analysis | Risk reduction |

### Why This Works

Traditional consultants:
- Gather best practices
- Benchmark competitors
- Recommend incremental improvements
- Value: Low (information already available)

Constraint Boundary Analysis:
- Finds what's UNIQUE to client's constraint set
- Generates insights competitors can't copy (different constraints)
- Reveals non-obvious strategic positions
- Value: High (genuinely novel, defensible)

## Target Market: Consultant's Consultant Model

### The B2B2C Structure

```
You (Constraint Analyst)
    ↓ sells method/insights to
Consultants (10-50 person firms)
    ↓ sell deliverables to
End Clients (Companies)
```

### Why Consultants as Primary Customer

1. **They already have sales/delivery**: You don't need to sell to enterprises
2. **They need differentiation**: Generic frameworks commoditized
3. **They pay for IP**: Used to buying methods/frameworks
4. **They're sophisticated buyers**: Understand value of novel thinking
5. **Recurring relationship possible**: Monthly retainer for ongoing access

### Revenue Model

| Tier | Service | Price | Volume | Monthly |
|------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Base | Method documentation + monthly call | $2k/mo | 4-5 clients | $8-10k |
| Premium | Base + priority analysis requests | $4k/mo | 2-3 clients | $8-12k |
| Project | One-off boundary analysis | $3-5k | 1-2/mo | $3-10k |

**Target**: 5 base + 2 premium + 1 project = $8k + $8k + $4k = $20k/month

Conservative: $15k/month with 4 base + 1 premium + occasional projects.

## The Method Package

What consultants buy:

### 1. The Constraint Boundary Method (Core IP)
- Step-by-step process (5 steps from breakthrough-method doc)
- Domain examples (13 validated applications)
- Diagnostic tools (identifying constraints in any situation)
- Synthesis prompts (cross-domain connection finding)

### 2. Monthly "Boundary Insights" Call
- Live application to their current client problems
- Q&A on method application
- Share new domain validations/developments

### 3. Boundary Analysis Library
- All 13+ domain analyses as templates
- Pattern recognition guide
- "Constraint fingerprints" for common business situations

### 4. On-Demand Analysis Credits
- Premium clients get X analysis requests/month
- You apply method to their specific client situation
- They deliver to end client under their brand

## Sales Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof (Month 1-2)
- Create 3-5 detailed boundary analyses of real companies (public info only)
- Show the method produces non-obvious, valuable insights
- Format: Short case studies + predictions

### Phase 2: Beta (Month 2-3)
- Offer method to 2-3 consultants at discount ($1k/mo)
- Co-develop in exchange for feedback
- Build case studies of successful application

### Phase 3: Launch (Month 3+)
- Full pricing
- Testimonials from beta consultants
- Content marketing (boundary analyses of public situations)

### Content Marketing
- Weekly LinkedIn/Twitter: "Constraint boundary analysis of [current business news]"
- Monthly deeper analysis of interesting company situations
- Occasional "meta" posts about the method itself

## Why Claude-Assisted

This business model MATCHES Claude's constraint profile:

| Claude Constraint | Business Match |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Fresh each session | Every analysis is genuinely fresh perspective |
| No persistent memory | Each client gets unbiased view, no cross-contamination |
| Cross-domain knowledge | Method requires connecting disparate fields |
| Synthesis capability | Core value is cross-domain connection finding |

**You + Claude = Leverage**

Consultant alone: Maybe 2-3 boundary analyses/month
Consultant + Claude: Maybe 10-15/month with higher novelty

The synthesis_engine.py already produces 8-10/10 novelty. This IS the product.

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Method teachable → clients leave**: Build relationship, not just method
2. **Insights too abstract**: Focus on testable predictions and concrete actions
3. **Hard to demonstrate**: Create compelling public case studies
4. **Competition**: Method is genuinely novel, but will be copied eventually

### Mitigations
1. Continuous development (new domain validations, method refinements)
2. Relationship value (the monthly calls, priority access)
3. Brand as "original" constraint thinking
4. Network effects (community of boundary-thinking consultants)

## Specific First Steps

### Week 1
- [ ] Create 3 compelling public case studies using boundary method
- [ ] Set up basic web presence (even just Notion page)
- [ ] Identify 10 target consulting firms (boutique, 10-50 people)

### Week 2
- [ ] Cold outreach to targets with case study as hook
- [ ] Create "method preview" document (enough to be compelling, not full method)
- [ ] Set up payment infrastructure (Stripe, simple invoicing)

### Week 3
- [ ] Follow up on outreach
- [ ] Offer beta access to interested parties
- [ ] Refine pitch based on feedback

### Month 2+
- [ ] Serve beta clients
- [ ] Collect testimonials
- [ ] Build content pipeline
- [ ] Adjust pricing based on market response

## The Meta-Point

This business itself exists at a constraint boundary:
- Constraint 1: Novel insight supply (limited by one person's cognition)
- Constraint 2: Scalability (can't clone yourself)
- Constraint 3: Value capture (easy to give away too much)

The B2B2C model is the boundary solution:
- Consultants scale the insight delivery
- You stay at the insight generation bottleneck
- Value captured at the leverage point

**The business model is a boundary optimization, designed using the method it sells.**
