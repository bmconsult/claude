# War Hypothesis: Conflict at Territorial Boundaries

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (38th domain validation)
**Question**: What is war at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Group conflict faces constraints:

1. **Resources**: Limited, contested
2. **Territory**: Physical space
3. **Power**: Relative strength
4. **Security**: Protection needs
5. **Identity**: Group boundaries

## Core Hypothesis

**War is violent boundary negotiation.**

Not just "conflict over resources" but "forceful boundary repositioning."

## Key Insights

### 1. War as Boundary Violence (10/10)

What is war really?

**Using force to move boundaries.**

Territorial: Move physical boundaries
Economic: Move resource boundaries
Ideological: Move belief boundaries

**War is boundary change by violence.**

### 2. Peace as Stable Boundaries (9/10)

What is peace?

**Stable boundary configuration.**

Not "absence of conflict" but "accepted boundaries."
War returns when boundaries become contested.

### 3. Deterrence at Force Boundary (8/10)

Why does deterrence work?

**It raises the cost of boundary movement.**

Nuclear deterrence: "Moving boundaries will destroy us both."
Makes boundary position frozen.

## The Deepest Insight

Why does war exist?

**Because boundaries shift but acceptance doesn't.**

When constraints change but boundaries don't, tension builds.
War is release of boundary tension.

**War is failed boundary negotiation.**
