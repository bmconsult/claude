# Money Hypothesis: Value at Exchange Boundaries

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (37th domain validation)
**Question**: What is money at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Exchange systems face constraints:

1. **Double coincidence**: Must match wants
2. **Divisibility**: Must split for transactions
3. **Portability**: Must transport
4. **Durability**: Must last
5. **Acceptability**: Must be trusted
6. **Scarcity**: Must not be trivially created

## Core Hypothesis

**Money exists at the boundary where trust meets scarcity.**

Not just "medium of exchange" but "crystallized boundary position."

## Key Insights

### 1. Money as Boundary Marker (10/10)

What is money really?

**A claim on future boundary positions.**

Money represents: Right to occupy certain economic positions.
Value: Distance from boundary of having nothing.

**Money IS boundary claim.**

### 2. Inflation/Deflation as Boundary Drift (9/10)

What is inflation?

**The money-value boundary drifting.**

Same money, different boundary position.
Purchasing power is boundary location.

### 3. Cryptocurrency at Trust Boundary (8/10)

What problem does crypto solve?

**Who maintains the boundary.**

Fiat: Government maintains (trust in state)
Crypto: Protocol maintains (trust in math)

**Different trust boundaries, same money function.**

## The Deepest Insight

Why does money exist?

**Because exchange requires boundary coordination.**

Money is how strangers coordinate boundaries without knowing each other.

**Money is formalized boundary trust.**
