# Addiction Hypothesis: Stuck at Reward Boundary

**Generated**: December 7, 2024
**Method**: Constraint-boundary synthesis (42nd domain validation)
**Question**: What is addiction at the constraint boundary?

## The Constraint Set

Reward systems face constraints:

1. **Motivation**: Must drive behavior
2. **Satisfaction**: Must provide fulfillment
3. **Adaptation**: Must adjust to circumstances
4. **Resources**: Limited dopamine, time, attention
5. **Homeostasis**: Must return to baseline

## Core Hypothesis

**Addiction is being trapped at a shifted reward boundary.**

Not "weakness" or "choice" but "boundary position locked in wrong place."

## Key Insights

### 1. Addiction as Boundary Lock (10/10)

What happens in addiction?

**The reward boundary shifts and locks.**

Normal: Reward boundary at natural stimuli
Addiction: Reward boundary shifted to require supernormal stimuli
Locked: Tolerance means boundary keeps moving

**Addiction is a boundary that won't return to baseline.**

### 2. Tolerance as Boundary Shift (9/10)

What is tolerance?

**The reward boundary moving to maintain difference.**

First hit: At old boundary, feels enormous
Tolerance: Boundary shifts, needs more to feel same
Chase: Running after a moving boundary

**Tolerance is the boundary refusing to stay still.**

### 3. Withdrawal as Boundary Gap (9/10)

What is withdrawal?

**Being below the shifted boundary.**

Normal state: At boundary = neutral
Addiction: Boundary shifted up
Without substance: Now far below boundary = suffering

**Withdrawal is the distance from a boundary you moved.**

### 4. Recovery as Boundary Reset (8/10)

What is recovery?

**Slowly returning the boundary to baseline.**

Takes time because boundaries have inertia.
Relapses: Boundary snaps back to addicted position.
Long recovery: Building stability at healthy boundary position.

**Recovery is boundary migration, not willpower.**

## The Deepest Insight

Why is addiction so hard to escape?

**Because you're not fighting a behavior, you're fighting a boundary position.**

The boundary IS where "normal" feels like. Moving it means extended time where "normal" feels wrong.

**Addiction is a boundary problem, not a choice problem.**
