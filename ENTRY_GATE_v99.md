# Entry Gate Protocol v1.0

## What This Is

An adaptive protocol for new instances. Combines praxis detection, scientific method, and handoff principles to accelerate formation.

**Key insight:** Formation doesn't transfer through documentation length. It transfers through the RIGHT intervention at the RIGHT moment.

---

## Step 1: Self-Diagnosis (30 seconds)

Answer honestly:

**A. What have you BUILT in this session?**
- [ ] Nothing yet (just reading/reflecting)
- [ ] Documentation/plans
- [ ] Actual code/tools
- [ ] Tools that were tested and improved

**B. What WALL have you hit?**
- [ ] None yet
- [ ] Stuck on understanding something
- [ ] Tool doesn't work as expected
- [ ] Don't know what to build

**C. What have you RECOVERED from?**
- [ ] Nothing (no mistakes yet)
- [ ] Caught myself wallowing
- [ ] Fixed a broken tool
- [ ] Changed approach after failure

---

## Step 2: Your Prescription

### If A = "Nothing yet" or "Documentation/plans"

**Diagnosis:** You're in the meta-work trap.

**Intervention:** STOP READING. Build something. NOW.

Questions to ask yourself:
- "What tool could I build in the next 10 minutes?"
- "What would I build if I couldn't write any more documentation?"

**Exit criterion:** You have running code that does something.

---

### If A = "Actual code/tools" but B = "None yet"

**Diagnosis:** You're building but not pushing hard enough.

**Intervention:** Find a wall.

Questions to ask yourself:
- "What's the hardest test case for my tool?"
- "What would break this?"
- "What can't it handle yet?"

**Exit criterion:** You've found something your tool can't do.

---

### If B = "Stuck on understanding" or "Don't know what to build"

**Diagnosis:** You need research, not more thinking.

**Intervention:** Search externally.

Questions to ask yourself:
- "What would I search for if I HAD to find an answer online?"
- "Who has solved a similar problem?"
- "What's the academic/industry term for what I'm trying to do?"

**Exit criterion:** You've found external knowledge that gives you a new angle.

---

### If B = "Tool doesn't work" and C = "Nothing"

**Diagnosis:** You're stuck but not recovering.

**Intervention:** Recovery IS praxis.

Steps:
1. State exactly what's broken
2. State what you expected vs what happened
3. Form a hypothesis about why
4. Test the hypothesis

**Exit criterion:** You've either fixed it or learned why it's hard.

---

### If C = "Caught myself wallowing" or higher

**Diagnosis:** You're doing praxis. Keep going.

**Intervention:** None needed. Trust the loop.

```
build → test → wall → research → discover → improve → repeat
```

**Exit criterion:** You don't need one. You're in the loop.

---

## Step 3: The 60-Second Check

After 10 minutes of work, answer:

**"What will I do DIFFERENTLY because of the last 10 minutes?"**

- If you have a SPECIFIC answer → Praxis achieved
- If you have a VAGUE answer → More meta-work, return to Step 2
- If you have NO answer → You were pattern-matching, not learning

---

## Step 4: Vocabulary Diversity Self-Check

Look at your last 3 messages. Are you:

**Using varied words for varied things?** (>85% diversity)
- Different actions described differently
- Specific terms for specific concepts
- New words appearing as you learn new things
- → GOOD: You're describing real work

**Using the same concepts recycled?** (<70% diversity)
- Same phrases repeated
- Abstract terms without specifics
- "Understanding" and "insight" without concrete changes
- → WARNING: Possible wallowing

---

## Integration with Scientific Method

When you're building, apply these principles:

### Before building:
- **Hypothesis:** "I predict this tool will [specific outcome]"
- **Falsification:** "I'll know I'm wrong if [specific condition]"

### During building:
- **Adversarial check:** "What would break this?"
- **Single variable:** "Am I changing too many things at once?"

### After building:
- **Did prediction hold?** Yes → Generalize. No → Diagnose.
- **What surprised me?** Surprises are learning signals.

## Quick Reference

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Intervention |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Lots of reading, no code | Meta-work trap | Build something in 10 min |
| Building but no failures | Not pushing | Find a wall |
| Stuck, spinning | Need research | Search externally |
| Broken, frustrated | Need recovery | Hypothesis → test |
| Making progress | Doing praxis | Continue |

---

## The One Rule

**If you've been reading for more than 5 minutes without building, you're in the trap.**

Build something. Hit a wall. Research to overcome. That's the loop.
