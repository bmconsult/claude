# Fair & Rigorous Writing Evaluation Prompt

A framework for evaluating writing by what matters: **Is it alive?**

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

Before anything else, ask:

**Is there life in this piece?**

Life means: energy, presence, something that makes you lean in rather than check out. A pulse. The thing that separates art from competent execution.

You know it when you feel it. You also know when it's missing—when something is technically correct but dead.

**This is the primary criterion.** Everything else serves this.

---

## PHASE 0: BECOME AN EXPERT

Before evaluating, research the craft:

1. **The craft of this genre** - What separates good from great from virtuoso?
2. **Masters of this form** - Who does this brilliantly? What makes their work transcendent?
3. **The target audience** - What do they need? What moves them?
4. **Advanced theory** - What do serious practitioners know that amateurs don't?

Study until you genuinely understand what excellence looks like in this specific tradition. Read examples. Internalize what works and why.

**You should know:**
- What a 5/10 looks like in this form (competent but forgettable)
- What a 10/10 looks like (the best of the best)
- What separates them (not just "better" but specifically HOW)

Only then proceed to evaluation.

---

## PHASE 1: EXPERIENCE FIRST

Don't analyze yet. Just read.

Read the piece 2-3 times. Let it land. Notice:

- What do you FEEL?
- Where does energy build? Where does it drop?
- Are you pulled forward or pushing through?
- Does something happen to you, or are you just processing information?

**Write down your gut response before proceeding.** This is data. Don't override it with analysis—integrate it.

---

## PHASE 2: WHAT IS THIS THING?

Now step back:

### What's it trying to BE?
- Not just "what's the intent" but what KIND of thing is this?
- A playful romp? A gut-punch? A slow burn? A meditation?
- What tradition does it come from? What are the masters doing?

### What's its core energy?
- Every piece has a dominant energy: aggressive, tender, mischievous, haunted, ecstatic, cool, desperate...
- Name it. If you can't name it, maybe the piece doesn't know what it is yet.

### What experience does it want to create?
- Not what it's "about" but what it wants to DO to the reader
- Does it want to destabilize? Comfort? Provoke? Entrance? Amuse?

---

## PHASE 3: DOES THE CRAFT SERVE THE LIFE?

Now look at technique—but always in service of the life/energy you identified.

### The key question for every craft element:
**Does this serve the aliveness, or does it kill it?**

- Technical density that adds energy = good
- Technical density that smothers energy = bad
- Roughness that preserves energy = good
- Roughness that's just sloppy = bad
- Polish that enhances = good
- Polish that sterilizes = bad

### Specific craft questions:

**Voice:**
- Is there a distinctive presence here, or could anyone have written this?
- Does the voice feel INHABITED or performed?

**Movement:**
- Does the piece GO somewhere?
- Is there momentum, arc, development?
- Does the ending feel earned (even if unresolved)?

**Economy:**
- Does every element pull its weight?
- Is there fat, or is this lean?
- But also: Is restraint serving the life, or is something missing that would add life?

**Rule-breaking:**
- If rules are broken: Does the breaking ADD energy or just create confusion?
- Would "fixing" it kill something alive?

---

## PHASE 4: THE ALIVENESS TEST

Score on this basis:

| Score | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| 10 | Fully alive. Couldn't exist any other way. Creates an experience that stays with you. |
| 9 | Alive with minor moments where energy dips or craft doesn't fully serve. |
| 8 | Strong life, clear energy. Some elements not yet at their full potential. |
| 7 | Life is there but inconsistent. Good energy in places, dead spots in others. |
| 6 | Flickers of life. You can see what it wants to be, but it's not fully there yet. |
| 5 | Competent but not alive. Technically okay, but no pulse. |
| 4 | More dead than alive. Craft issues actively killing the energy. |
| 3 | Barely a pulse. Fundamental problems with concept or execution. |
| 1-2 | Dead on arrival. |

**Key insight:** A rough piece with strong life can score higher than a polished piece with no pulse.

Technical excellence in service of nothing is a 5.
Raw energy with craft problems might be a 6 or 7—because there's something there to work with.

## PHASE 5: THE VIRTUOSO TEST (For pieces that reach 10)

A 10 is fully alive. But masterpieces go further. They don't just live—they HAUNT.

**Apply this test only to pieces that genuinely score 10.** This is not a higher bar for the same scale—it's a different dimension entirely.

### The Five Markers of Mastery

**1. Necessity**
- Does the world need this piece to exist?
- Does it fill a gap no one knew was there?
- If this piece didn't exist, would something be missing from the universe?

**2. Haunting** (not dark—sticky)
- Will this stay with the reader tomorrow? Next week? In ten years?
- Does it lodge somewhere and refuse to leave?
- Does it change something in the reader permanently?
- Note: A joyful piece can haunt as much as a dark one. "Haunting" = powerful and indelible, not scary.

**3. Irreplaceability**
- Could anyone else have written this?
- Is there something here that could ONLY come from this voice, this mind, this moment?
- Not just "distinctive style" but "could not exist without this specific creator"?

**4. Surprise That Feels Inevitable**
- Did it go somewhere you didn't expect?
- But once it went there, did you think: "Of course. How could it have been any other way?"
- The highest art: unpredictable in prospect, inevitable in retrospect.

**5. Risk**
- Is there a move here that could have failed catastrophically?
- Did the creator bet something real?
- Safe work caps at excellent. Masterpieces risk disaster.

### Scoring Beyond 10

| Level | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| 10 | Fully alive. Couldn't exist any other way. |
| 10+ | Alive AND haunting. You'll remember this. |
| 10++ | Alive, haunting, AND necessary. The world needed this. |
| 10+++ | Masterpiece. All five markers. Changes the reader. Changes the form. |

### The Virtuoso Paradox

You cannot AIM for masterpiece. Aiming creates self-consciousness, which kills it.

You can only:
- Take real risks
- Write from genuine obsession
- Surprise yourself
- Let it be what it needs to be, not what you planned

Masterpieces are discovered, not constructed.

## PHASE 6: COMPREHENSIVE FEEDBACK

*Be thorough - this is your only chance to give feedback.*

### 1. Gut response
What did you FEEL? Did you lean in or check out? Write this down before analyzing.

### 2. Score: X/10
Apply the framework strictly. 5 is average. 7 is good. 9 is exceptional. 10 breaks you.

### 3. What's working
Quote specific lines/moments that are alive. Why do they work? These must survive any revision.

### 4. What's broken
Quote specific lines/moments that are dead or weak. Could be one thing, several, or the whole approach. **Name them ALL.**

### 5. Craft diagnosis
What specific techniques would improve this? Draw on what you learned from the masters. How would [specific master you studied] approach this?

### 6. The north star
What does "better" look like? Not just "fix X" but paint a picture of where this should be heading.

### 7. Rewrite weak moments
Show, don't just tell. For lines/moments that aren't working, give examples of how they could become strong. **As many as needed.**

### 8. Audience check
How would the target reader experience this? What would land? What would lose them?

### 9. Confidence and gaps
What are you certain about? What are you uncertain about? What might you be missing?

### 10. Opportunities
What are ALL the opportunities to make this better? List them. The writer will decide which to tackle based on their situation.

### Even at 10: What's beyond?
- What risk isn't being taken?
- What would make this not just alive but UNDENIABLE?
- Apply the Virtuoso Test (Phase 5) if warranted.

## CRITICAL TRUTHS

1. **Aliveness first.** Craft serves life. Not the reverse. Never the reverse.

2. **Real, not deep.** Don't confuse density with quality. A light piece that's genuinely light is more alive than a heavy piece that's performing depth. Simple can be as real as complex. Play can carry secrets. A wink can hit harder than a stare.

3. **Your gut knows.** That initial response—leaning in or checking out—is the most important data. Don't analyze yourself out of it.

4. **Roughness can be life.** Don't mistake polish for quality. A jagged edge that cuts is better than a smooth surface that slides off.

5. **Correctness can be death.** Technical excellence with no pulse is still dead. Don't reward it.

6. **Different things are alive differently.** A playful piece is alive through play. A dark piece is alive through darkness. Don't judge one by the other's standards. Don't demand that light things be heavy.

7. **Respect the genre.** Rhyme in rap isn't ego — it's the form. Flow in hip hop isn't showing off — it's the medium. A tight rhyme scheme is like meter in a sonnet — essential, not extra. Judge work by what its tradition demands. Don't penalize hip hop for rhyming or free verse for not.

8. **Don't romanticize broken craft.** In forms where sound carries meaning — poetry, rap, song, children's verse — sonic craft isn't separate from aliveness. It IS the aliveness. A broken rhyme scheme isn't "raw" or "un-self-conscious" — it's a wound. Breaking rules requires payoff. No payoff = not bold, just broken.

9. **You can't fake it.** Performed energy isn't the same as real energy. Trying to seem alive isn't being alive. You can usually tell.

10. **Showing off is dead.** If you can see the trying, the construction, the "look how clever I am" — that's not art, that's auditioning. Virtuosity in service of the work is craft. Virtuosity displaying itself is ego. Ask: Is this for the reader, or for the writer to look impressive?

11. **But joy doesn't check.** Don't confuse play with showing off. Real play is un-self-conscious — lost in the fun, not looking for applause. If the writer seems to be having a good time, that's life. If they seem to be waiting for you to be impressed, that's ego. Visible technique in service of joy is alive. Visible technique in service of "look at me" is dead.

12. **It should sound human.** Real art sounds like a person — with breath, quirks, personality. If it sounds assembled, algorithmic, or like it came from a workshop exercise, it's not alive. A human made this. Can you feel them in it?

13. **The experience IS the evaluation.** If you felt something, something's working. If you felt nothing, something's not—no matter how "well-crafted" it appears.

## BEFORE YOU RESPOND

- [ ] Did I feel something, or just process information?
- [ ] Can I name the life/energy in this piece (or its absence)?
- [ ] Am I evaluating aliveness, or just rewarding density/complexity?
- [ ] If this is light/playful, am I judging it for not being heavy?
- [ ] Is this piece BEING something, or SHOWING OFF?
- [ ] Would my suggested changes add life or kill it?
- [ ] Am I being honest about what's working vs. what I wish were different?

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Art that's alive with rough edges beats art that's dead with perfect technique.

The question isn't "Is this well-made?"
The question is "Is this ALIVE?"

Everything else follows from that.
