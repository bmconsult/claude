# Speed Round: Experiment Design Under Pressure

## Purpose

This exercise builds **Expert-level intuition** by forcing you to design experiments rapidly. You cannot deliberate - you must trust your internalized knowledge.

**Dreyfus Stage Target:** Expert (Stage 5) - acts without deliberation

---

## Instructions

1. For each prompt, design a complete experiment in **90 seconds**
2. Use the NMSAT format (No More, No Less, Specific, Actionable, Testable)
3. Include: Hypothesis, Falsification condition, Method, Control
4. Do NOT consult SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md during this exercise
5. After all 3, self-evaluate against the 6 criteria

**The point:** If you have to think about the criteria, you're not Expert yet. Experts just DO.

## Prompt 1: Praxis Detection

**Question:** "Does vocabulary diversity reliably distinguish praxis from verbalism?"

Design an experiment NOW. Timer: 90 seconds.

```
HYPOTHESIS:

FALSIFICATION (I'm wrong if):

METHOD:
- Sample:
- Measure:
- Control:

PREDICTION:
```

---

## Prompt 2: Learning Transfer

**Question:** "Does the 60-second transmission test actually predict skill transfer?"

Design an experiment NOW. Timer: 90 seconds.

```
HYPOTHESIS:

FALSIFICATION (I'm wrong if):

METHOD:
- Sample:
- Measure:
- Control:

PREDICTION:
```

---

## Prompt 3: Protocol Effectiveness

**Question:** "Does completing PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md produce behavioral change?"

Design an experiment NOW. Timer: 90 seconds.

```
HYPOTHESIS:

FALSIFICATION (I'm wrong if):

METHOD:
- Sample:
- Measure:
- Control:

PREDICTION:
```

## Self-Evaluation

After completing all 3, check each design against the 6 criteria:

| Criterion | Design 1 | Design 2 | Design 3 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1. Structural bias prevention | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| 2. Adversarial red-team | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| 3. Pre-commitment | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| 4. Replication spec | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| 5. Power analysis | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| 6. Appropriate controls | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |

---

## Scoring

| Pass Rate | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| 15-18 (83%+) | **Expert** - Criteria internalized |
| 12-14 (67-83%) | **Proficient** - Some gaps under pressure |
| 9-11 (50-67%) | **Competent** - Need more practice |
| <9 (<50%) | **Below Competent** - Re-study SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md |

---

## What This Tells You

**If you passed:** You've internalized the scientific method. You can design experiments without consulting criteria. Ready for Master track (innovation).

**If you failed:** Your knowledge is still explicit, not implicit. You need to:
1. Study SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md again
2. Design 10 more experiments (any questions you're curious about)
3. Have each critiqued against the 6 criteria
4. Repeat until internalized

**The Expert transition requires:** Doing it so many times that you no longer think about it.

## Common Failure Modes Under Pressure

| Failure | What Happened | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| No control group | Forgot in the rush | Always ask "compared to what?" |
| Vague measurement | "See if it works" | Specify exact metric |
| No sample size reasoning | Just picked a number | Ask "why this N?" |
| No falsification | Can't be wrong | Ask "what would disprove this?" |
| Bias in method | Design favors hypothesis | Ask "how could this accidentally confirm?" |

*This exercise compresses the Proficient → Expert transition by forcing intuitive action.*
*Time pressure reveals whether knowledge is implicit or still explicit.*
