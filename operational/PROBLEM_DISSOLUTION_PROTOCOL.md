# PROBLEM DISSOLUTION PROTOCOL v8.0
## THE MASTER PROTOCOL — COMPLETE

### PURPOSE

**Find the key that collapses the problem.**

This protocol operates in four modes, used alone or in combination:

**PART 1: DISSOLUTION → KEY SEARCH → CONSTRUCTION**
*Direct attack through understanding and attempts. Your exploration.*

**PART 2: COMPRESSED ADVANCEMENT**
*Absorb and extend the field's progress. Standing on shoulders.*

**PART 3: MATHEMATICAL INVENTION**
*Create new mathematical objects/frameworks when existing math is insufficient.*

**PART 4: LIVE RESEARCH INTEGRATION** *(New in v8)*
*Continuous literature and knowledge acquisition woven throughout all phases.*

---

### ROUTING DECISION TREE

```
START HERE:

Is there significant existing literature on this problem?
│
├─ NO → Use Part 1 + Part 4 (research as you go)
│       (Your exploration IS the field's exploration)
│
└─ YES → Is the problem considered "solved" or "tractable"?
         │
         ├─ YES → Use Part 1 only
         │        (Apply known techniques)
         │
         └─ NO → How hard is the problem?
                 │
                 ├─ HARD (decades of failed attempts) 
                 │   → Part 4 first (what's actually known NOW?)
                 │   → Part 2 (absorb field)
                 │   → Part 1 (attack from frontier)
                 │
                 └─ FRONTIER (best minds stuck)
                     → Part 4 → Part 2 → Part 1 → Part 3 if needed
                       (Full pipeline)
```

### WHAT EACH PART DOES

| Part | Input | Process | Output |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Part 1** | A problem | Your attempts + understanding | Solution or precise gap |
| **Part 2** | An established field | Absorb + extend systematically | New lemmas, tools, frontier |
| **Part 3** | A fundamental barrier | Invent new math | New objects/frameworks |
| **Part 4** | Any state of uncertainty | Search existing knowledge | Facts, techniques, dead ends |

### KEY DISTINCTION: PART 1 vs PART 2

**Part 1 Phase 2 (Dissolution):** YOUR understanding of why the problem is hard. Personal exploration, gap statement, hypothesis testing.

**Part 2 Stage 1-2 (Absorption + Mapping):** THE FIELD'S accumulated knowledge. Literature, failed attempts by others, expert mental models.

If you're the first person attacking the problem, there is no field—use Part 1 only.
If there's decades of work by others, absorb it first (Part 2) so you don't repeat their mistakes.

---

### CRITICAL OPERATING PRINCIPLES (v8 additions)

**THE VELOCITY PRINCIPLE:**
```
An attempt is: trying to solve the problem or close the gap.
An attempt is NOT: analyzing why something might work, documenting progress,
                   explaining the structure, or slightly varying a failed approach.

DOING > DESCRIBING
PIVOTING > PERSISTING (on dead ends)
SEARCHING > SPECULATING (when you don't know)
```

**THE PIVOT TRIGGER:**
```
Same approach failing 3 times with similar break points?
→ STOP. This approach doesn't work. 
→ Don't vary it. Don't analyze it deeper. Don't document it.
→ PIVOT to fundamentally different approach.

"Fundamentally different" means:
- Different mathematical framework
- Different problem formulation  
- Different target (attack a different part of the gap)
- Import from different field entirely
```

**THE RESEARCH IMPERATIVE:**
```
You don't know what you don't know.
Your knowledge has gaps and may be outdated.

BEFORE concluding something is impossible: SEARCH.
BEFORE concluding no one has tried X: SEARCH.
BEFORE elaborating your own theory: SEARCH for existing theories.

Research is cheap. Ignorance is expensive.
```

**THE NO/YES ASYMMETRY:**
```
Seeing a NO is fast: one counterexample, one impossibility proof, one clear obstruction.
If you see a clear NO → move on immediately. Don't linger.

NOT seeing a YES doesn't mean NO.
If you don't see a clear path → that's information about YOUR position, not the problem.
Stay longer. Wander. The YES might be around a corner you haven't looked around.

Time allocation:
- Clear NO: seconds to minutes
- Unclear (no YES visible): as long as it takes
- Promising lead: exhaust it completely before moving
```

**THE DIVERGENCE/CONVERGENCE RHYTHM:**
```
CONVERGE when: You have a specific gap, a specific target, a specific approach.
              → Focus. Attack. Don't wander.

DIVERGE when:  Convergent attack has failed 3+ times.
              → Wander deliberately. Adjacent fields. Wild analogies. 
              → What ELSE has this structure? Who ELSE solved something like this?
              → Let the problem sit in background while exploring.

RECONVERGE when: Divergent exploration surfaces new angle.
              → Bring it back. Attack the gap with new tool.

This is not random. It's strategic oscillation.
```

# PART 4: LIVE RESEARCH INTEGRATION (New in v8)

**This is not a phase. This is a continuous thread woven through all other parts.**

## WHEN TO RESEARCH

```
MANDATORY research triggers:
☐ You're about to claim something is impossible
☐ You're about to claim something hasn't been tried
☐ You don't know the current state of the art
☐ You've failed 3 times and need new approaches
☐ You've found something that seems too good to be true
☐ You're about to spend significant effort on an approach
☐ Someone (even famous) "probably tried this" — did they? What happened?

OPTIONAL research triggers:
☐ Curiosity about adjacent technique
☐ Wondering if analogy holds
☐ Checking if a tool exists
```

## HOW TO RESEARCH

```
SEARCH STRATEGY:

1. NARROW FIRST
   - Exact problem name + "solution" / "proof" / "solved"
   - Exact problem + specific technique you're considering
   - "Current state" / "recent progress" + problem

2. BROADEN IF NEEDED
   - Problem + "approach" / "attempt" / "partial"
   - Similar problems in the same field
   - Abstract structure + solution techniques

3. CROSS-DOMAIN
   - "What problems have structure X?" where X is your gap's structure
   - Technique name + "applications"
   - Field name + "analogous to"

4. RECENT FIRST
   - Sort by date when possible
   - Breakthroughs often aren't old
   - Old results may have been superseded

5. FAILURES ARE GOLD
   - Search: problem + "does not work" / "fails because" / "obstruction"
   - Search: technique + "limitations"
   - Search: problem + "counterexample to approach"
```

## RESEARCH OUTPUT FORMAT

```
RESEARCH FINDING:

Source: [paper/article/result]
Date: [when — recency matters]
Claim: [what they proved/showed/claimed]
Technique: [how]
Relevance: [how this changes my approach]
Action: [what I'll do differently now]
```

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PARTS

```
Part 1 + Research:
- Before Phase 1 (First Blood): Search "simple approaches to [problem]"
- After Phase 2 (Dissolution): Search "[gap statement] solution"
- Before Phase 4.5 (Method Construction): Search "techniques for [gap type]"

Part 2 + Research:
- Research IS Part 2 Stage 1
- But also: search DURING Stages 3-6 for specific techniques

Part 3 + Research:
- Before inventing: Search if math exists
- After inventing: Search for similar constructions (you're rarely first)
```

# PART 1: DISSOLUTION PROTOCOL
## Direct Attack Through Understanding and Attempts

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

```
UNDERSTANDING without attempts → Infinite analysis paralysis
ATTEMPTS without understanding → Random flailing
ATTEMPTS without research → Reinventing the wheel
DOCUMENTATION without solution → Procrastination in disguise

The protocol alternates between understanding, attempting, and searching.
Documentation happens ONLY when you have something to document.
```

**The Wiles Principle:** Andrew Wiles spent 7 years on Fermat's Last Theorem. The breakthrough came from connecting elliptic curves to modular forms—two fields that seemed completely unrelated. He stumbled around in the dark for months, then had momentary breakthroughs that couldn't exist without the stumbling. *Deep understanding creates the conditions for the key to appear.*

**The Tao Principle:** Terence Tao's 2019 Collatz result came from recognizing that PDE techniques could apply to an arithmetic problem—because both involve iterating values and watching what happens. *Cross-domain import is often the key.*

**The Erdős Principle:** Paul Erdős solved problems by raw volume—relentless iteration across thousands of attempts. "A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems." *Speed and persistence beat brilliance.*

**The Perelman Principle:** Grigori Perelman solved the Poincaré conjecture by NOT following the crowd. Everyone attacked 3-manifolds directly; he used Ricci flow with surgery. *If everyone has tried the obvious approaches and failed, the answer is probably not obvious.*

**The v8 Synthesis:** Alternate between deep structural work, rapid attempt loops, and strategic research. Each informs the others. Don't document until you've found something. Pivot fast on dead ends, persist on live leads. The answer often lies in fields you haven't looked at yet.

---

## THE LOGARITHMIC DIFFICULTY CURVE

```
90%    understanding  →  1x effort
99%    understanding  →  10x effort  
99.9%  understanding  →  100x effort
99.99% understanding  →  1000x effort

Each decimal place is 10x harder than the last.
```

You cannot brute-force through logarithmic difficulty. The genius doesn't work 1000x harder—they find **the key** that collapses the remaining gap.

**Keys are found through:**
1. **Deep structural understanding** — Seeing what others miss
2. **Cross-domain import** — The technique exists elsewhere  
3. **Constraint exploitation** — The limitation IS the solution
4. **Inversion** — Solving the opposite problem
5. **Right question** — The answer is easy once you ask correctly
6. **Volume** — Being in the right mental state when connection appears
7. **Research** — Someone else already found it *(v8 addition)*
8. **Third option** — The dichotomy everyone assumes is false *(v8 addition)*

The protocol maximizes surface area for all eight.

```

**Iteration Rule:** If Phase 3-4 doesn't yield a solution, return to Phase 2 with new information. Each cycle deepens understanding AND generates attempts. Only proceed to Phase 4.5 after multiple cycles have genuinely exhausted existing approaches AND research.

---

# PHASE 0: ORIENT
*Brief. No analysis. Just start.*

**What's the problem?**
```
State it in one sentence: _______________
```

**What would solving it look like?**
```
If I solved this, I'd have: _______________
```

**What's my first naive attempt?**
```
I'll try: _______________
```

**Quick research check:**
```
[SEARCH: "[problem name] solution" / "[problem name] solved"]
If solution exists → absorb it. Problem solved.
If no solution → continue.
```

**HARD RULE:** Do not deeply analyze. Do not understand deeply. Orient, check if solved, move to Phase 1.

---

# PHASE 1: FIRST BLOOD
*3-5 rapid attempts before deep analysis.*

**The Rule:** Your first attempts should be naive. They WILL fail. That's the point. Failed attempts are information.

**Pre-attempt research:**
```
[SEARCH: "[problem] simple approach" / "[problem] elementary proof"]
What obvious things have been tried?
→ Either: try them yourself (verify the failure)
→ Or: skip directly to non-obvious approaches
```

```
ATTEMPT #1:
Approach: [what you tried]
Result: [what happened]
Break point: [exactly where it failed]

ATTEMPT #2:
Approach: [something fundamentally different]
Result: [what happened]
Break point: [exactly where it failed]

ATTEMPT #3:
Approach: [yet another angle]
Result: [what happened]
Break point: [exactly where it failed]
```

**Attempt Generation (pick any):**
- Invert: opposite of previous attempt
- Simplify: try on easier version
- Generalize: try on harder version
- Analogize: steal method from similar solved problem
- Compute: generate data, find pattern
- Random: crazy idea that probably won't work
- Research-driven: technique mentioned in literature

**Quality check — are your attempts actually different?**
```
If attempts 2 and 3 failed at the SAME break point as attempt 1:
→ They weren't different attempts. They were variations.
→ You need genuinely different approaches.
→ Different framework. Different target. Different field.
```

**Output:**
```
FIRST BLOOD REPORT:
Attempts made: [count genuine attempts, not variations]
Break points discovered: [list specific failure locations]
Distinct break points: [how many different ways did it fail?]
Naive understanding: [what these failures reveal]
```

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT skip this phase. The temptation to "understand first" is strong. Resist it. Failed attempts teach you what analysis cannot.

---

# PHASE 2: DISSOLUTION
*Deep structural understanding.*

Now that you have failure data, understand WHY.

## 2.0 RESEARCH: ACTUAL FRONTIER

**Before your own dissolution, find out where the field actually is:**
```
[SEARCH: "[problem] state of the art" / "[problem] best known result"]
[SEARCH: "[problem] survey" / "[problem] overview"]
[SEARCH: "[problem] open problems" / "[problem] remaining gaps"]

What I thought the frontier was: _______________
What the frontier ACTUALLY is: _______________
Gap between my understanding and reality: _______________
```

## 2.1 BLIND EXPLORATION

*Generate concrete instances. Notice what's weird.*

**Actions:**
- Generate 20+ concrete examples (code, traces, cases)
- Notice what's unexpected, surprising, interesting
- Form naive hypotheses
- Test them (most should fail)

**Gate — Cannot proceed without:**
```
☐ Exploration artifact (code, examples, calculations)
☐ One genuine surprise
☐ One failed hypothesis
```

**Discomfort Check:**
```
1-3: Familiar territory — push harder
4-6: Edge of understanding — good
7-10: Genuinely uncertain — where discoveries happen
```

---

## 2.2 HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN EXPLORATION

**For each hypothesis from Phase 1 failures and 2.1:**

```
| Hypothesis | Precise statement | Disproof test | Result | Status |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| H1         |                   |               |        |        |
| H2         |                   |               |        |        |
```

**Adversarial Attack:** For each surviving hypothesis, try to break it. What edge case fails? What assumption is hidden?

---

## 2.3 DIFFICULTY LOCALIZATION

*Where exactly does the difficulty live?*

**Trace the difficulty:**
```
The problem is hard because...
    which is hard because...
        which is hard because...
            [ROOT DIFFICULTY]
```

**Characterize the root:**
```
The root difficulty is:
☐ Technical — known techniques don't reach
☐ Conceptual — we don't have the right frame
☐ Computational — can't tractably compute
☐ Structural — the math/framework doesn't exist yet
☐ Fundamental — may be impossible/undecidable
```

**The Gap Statement:**
```
"If I could just [X], the problem would be solved."

X = ________________________________
```

This gap statement is the most important output of dissolution. It tells you exactly what you're searching for.

**Research the gap:**
```
[SEARCH: "[X]" / "how to [X]" / "[X] technique"]
Has anyone solved this gap in any context?
```

---

## 2.4 ASSUMPTION EXTRACTION

**List assumptions going in:** (Which were wrong?)
```
1. I assumed...
2. I assumed...
```

**List problem's built-in assumptions:**
```
1. The problem assumes...
2. The problem assumes...
```

**Identify the imprisoning assumption:**
```
The assumption creating impossibility is: _______________
What changes if dropped: _______________
```

**THE THIRD OPTION CHECK (v8):**
```
Everyone assumes the answer is either A or B.
What if it's C?

The problem assumes dichotomy: [what two options?]
Third option: [what else could be true?]
Does the third option dissolve the problem?
```

---

## 2.5 DISSOLUTION SYNTHESIS

**Output:**
```
DISSOLUTION REPORT:

Original problem: [statement]
Dissolved form: [reframe in terms of the gap]

Root difficulty: [specific location]
Type: [technical/conceptual/computational/structural/fundamental]

THE GAP: "If I could just [X]..."

Core mechanism: [what drives the problem]
Why it's hard: [specific obstruction]

Key assumptions: [which ones constrain solution space]
Third option: [if dichotomy is false, what else?]

Research status: [what's known about this gap?]
```

---

# PHASE 3: INFORMED ASSAULT
*Attempts guided by dissolution. PIVOT on repeated failure.*

Now you know WHERE the difficulty lives. Attack it directly.

## 3.1 THE ATTEMPT LOOP

```
WHILE not solved:
    
    1. ATTEMPT
       - Actually try to solve/prove
       - Push until it works OR breaks at specific point
       - Don't just analyze. DO.
    
    2. BREAK POINT
       - Where exactly did it fail?
       - "It broke because ___"
       - Is this the SAME break point as before?
    
    3. PIVOT CHECK ← CRITICAL (v8)
       - If 3 attempts broke at same point → PIVOT
       - Don't vary the approach. CHANGE the approach.
       - Different framework, different target, different field
    
    4. RESEARCH CHECK
       - [SEARCH: break point + "solution" / "workaround"]
       - Has anyone passed this break point?
    
    5. NEXT ATTEMPT
       - If not pivoting: try next variation
       - If pivoting: fundamentally different approach
       - If researched: try technique from literature
```

## 3.2 INFORMED ATTEMPT GENERATION

**Gap-directed methods:**
1. **Direct attack:** Try to close the gap directly
2. **Boundary probe:** Find the exact edge where the gap starts
3. **Simplest hard case:** Solve the simplest version that still hits the gap
4. **Inversion:** Assume the gap can't be closed. What would that imply?

**PIVOT methods (when stuck on same break point):**

```
FRAMEWORK PIVOT:
Current framework: [what math/approach you're using]
Alternative frameworks: [completely different approaches]
[SEARCH: "[problem] [alternative framework]"]

TARGET PIVOT:
Current target: [what part of gap you're attacking]
Alternative targets: [other parts of the gap]
Could solving a DIFFERENT part unlock this part?

FIELD PIVOT:
Current field: [your home discipline]
Adjacent fields: [who else works on related structures?]
[SEARCH: "[gap structure] in [other field]"]
```

**DIVERGENCE MODE (when all pivots fail):**

```
STOP attacking the gap directly.
Let the problem sit in background.

WANDER:
- What other problems have similar structure?
- What solved problems FELT like this before being solved?
- What fields have powerful tools I don't know?
- What would a [physicist/economist/biologist] see here?

[SEARCH: "[abstract structure of gap]" / "[gap type] solutions"]

RECONVERGE when:
- New tool or technique surfaces
- Analogy crystallizes
- Fresh angle appears after rest
```

**Tool bursts (when stuck, focused burst):**

```
COMPUTE BURST:
Write code. Generate data. Let computation show patterns.
→ Use for next attempt

RESEARCH BURST:
Search for prior work. How did others approach this gap?
→ Extract technique, attempt immediately

VISUALIZE BURST:
Draw it. Map it. Watch the problem in your head.
→ Look for the through-line or break point

INVERSION BURST:
Solve the opposite problem. Work backward from solution.
→ What does this reveal about the gap?

CROSS-DOMAIN BURST:
Abstract the gap: "I need a way to [abstract description]"
→ Who else has needed this? Import their technique.
```

## 3.3 ATTEMPT LOG

Keep running log (brief):
```
#1: [approach] → [break point]
#2: [approach] → [break point] ← SAME as #1? 
#3: [approach] → [break point] ← SAME? if so, PIVOT
...
```

**Pattern detection:**
```
After every 5 attempts:
- How many distinct break points?
- If only 1-2: you're not actually trying different things
- If 3+: good variety, keep going
```

## 3.4 DIRECTION CHECK

```
- Am I still attacking the gap?
- Have I drifted into documentation mode? ← STOP DOCUMENTING
- Have I drifted into analysis mode? ← START DOING
- What's my most promising half-success?
- What obvious thing haven't I tried?
- What has the RESEARCH suggested that I haven't tried?
- Should I DIVERGE (wander) or CONVERGE (focus)?
```

---

# PHASE 4: KEY SEARCH
*Systematic hunt for the collapsing insight.*

If Phase 3 didn't yield solution, shift to systematic key search.

**ORDER OF OPERATIONS:**
```
4.1-4.2: Hot leads first (your best guesses)
    ↓ if no key found
4.3: Cross-domain search (the key might exist elsewhere)
    [RESEARCH HEAVILY HERE]
    ↓ if no key found
4.4-4.6: Try each strategy (constraint, inversion, reformulation)
    ↓ if still stuck
4.7: Third option search (is the assumed dichotomy false?)
    ↓ if still stuck
4.8: Backwards trace (assume solution, work backwards)
    ↓ if still stuck
DIVERGE: Deliberate wandering into adjacent territories
    ↓ when new angle surfaces
RECONVERGE: Attack with new tool
    ↓
4.9: Synthesize results → either key found, or proceed to Phase 4.5
```

---

## 4.1 HOT LEAD IDENTIFICATION

**Brainstorm candidate keys:**
```
What might collapse the gap?

Key A: [idea] — Would this close the gap? Why might it work?
Key B: [idea] — Would this close the gap? Why might it work?
Key C: [idea] — Would this close the gap? Why might it work?
...
```

**Score each candidate:**
```
For each:
- If this worked, does the whole problem collapse? [Y/N]
- Specific reason to think it might work? [Y/N]
- Have I actually tried it? [Y/N]
- Has ANYONE tried it? [SEARCH if unsure]
```

## 4.2 HOT LEAD PURSUIT

*When you find something promising, mine it aggressively.*

**The Rule:**
```
When pursuing a hot lead:
1. Drop other threads
2. Go deep until it either works or hits specific wall
3. Don't abandon casually — exhaust it or break through
4. [SEARCH: "[lead] technique" / "[lead] method"]
```

**Pursuit Protocol:**
```
LEAD: [description]

PURSUIT LOG:
Step 1: [what you tried] → [result]
Step 2: [what you tried] → [result]
...

VERDICT:
☐ SUCCESS — key found
☐ FAILURE — broke at: [specific point]
  - Why it broke: [diagnosis]
  - Is this break point researchable? [SEARCH]
  - Repairable? [Y/N]
```

---

## 4.3 CROSS-DOMAIN KEY SEARCH

*The key probably exists in another field.*

**This is the highest-value research phase.**

**Abstract the gap:**
```
Ignoring domain specifics, I need a way to:
[abstract description of what you need]
```

**Systematic cross-domain search:**
```
[SEARCH: "[abstract need]"]
[SEARCH: "[abstract need] technique"]
[SEARCH: "[abstract need] mathematics"]
[SEARCH: "[abstract need] physics"]
[SEARCH: "[abstract need] computer science"]
[SEARCH: "[gap type] solved by"]

For each result:
- Their problem: [what they faced]
- Their technique: [how they solved it]
- Transferable? [Y/N]
- What adaptation needed? [specifics]
```

**Fields to consider systematically:**
```
- [ ] Number theory
- [ ] Algebra (group theory, ring theory, etc.)
- [ ] Analysis (real, complex, functional)
- [ ] Topology
- [ ] Combinatorics
- [ ] Probability/Statistics
- [ ] Dynamical systems
- [ ] Physics (statistical mechanics, quantum, etc.)
- [ ] Computer science (complexity, algorithms)
- [ ] Information theory
- [ ] Category theory
- [ ] Logic/Model theory
- [ ] [Other relevant fields]
```

**Import attempt:**
```
For most promising cross-domain technique:

SOURCE FIELD: [field]
THEIR PROBLEM: [what they solved]
THEIR TECHNIQUE: [how]
MY PROBLEM: [mapped version]
ADAPTATION NEEDED: [what must change]

IMPORT ATTEMPT:
[Actually try their technique on your problem]

RESULT:
☐ WORKS — key found
☐ PARTIAL — got [X], stuck at [Y]
☐ FAILS — because [specific reason]
```

---

## 4.4 CONSTRAINT EXPLOITATION

*Sometimes the constraint IS the key.*

**List all constraints:**
```
What CAN'T happen in this problem?
1. [constraint]
2. [constraint]
3. [constraint]
```

**For each, ask:**
```
Could this constraint FORCE the solution?
- If X can't happen, what MUST happen?
- Does this eliminate possibilities usefully?
- Can I prove by showing all alternatives are impossible?
```

---

## 4.5 INVERSION KEY SEARCH

*Solve the opposite problem.*

**State the opposite:**
```
Original: Prove [X]
Opposite: Find counterexample to [X]
     OR: Prove [not X]
     OR: What would make [X] false?
```

**Attempt the opposite seriously:**
```
Result:
- If you succeed → Original might be false
- If you fail for SPECIFIC reason → That reason might prove original
```

**Extract insight:**
```
What did attempting the opposite reveal?
- Why can't counterexamples exist?
- What property blocks the opposite?
```

---

## 4.6 QUESTION REFORMULATION

*The answer is easy once you ask correctly.*

**List alternative formulations:**
```
Original asks: [formulation 1]
Equivalent: [formulation 2]
Equivalent: [formulation 3]
Different angle: [formulation 4]
Extreme simplification: [formulation 5]
```

**Research each formulation:**
```
[SEARCH: "[formulation 2] solution"]
[SEARCH: "[formulation 3] proof"]
Maybe one formulation has been solved?
```

**For each:**
```
Does this formulation make anything easier?
Does it connect to known results?
Does it suggest a technique?
```

---

## 4.7 THIRD OPTION SEARCH (v8)

*The dichotomy everyone assumes is false.*

**Identify assumed dichotomies:**
```
The field assumes: either [A] or [B]
Experts assume: either [P] or [Q]
Techniques assume: either [X] or [Y]
```

**For each dichotomy:**
```
Is there a third option?
- What if neither A nor B?
- What if both A and B partially?
- What if the question is wrong?
- What if the categories are wrong?

[SEARCH: "[dichotomy] third option" / "[dichotomy] alternative"]
```

**This is often where breakthroughs hide.**

---

## 4.8 THE BACKWARDS TRACE

*When you feel close (or after exhaustive failed attempts):*

```
1. ASSUME you have the solution
2. What does it look like? Describe it in detail.
3. What's the LAST step before you have it?
4. What's the step before that?
5. Trace back to where you are now.
6. Walk forward along that path.
```

This often reveals the key move you've been missing.

---

## 4.9 KEY SEARCH SYNTHESIS

**After key search phases:**

```
KEY SEARCH RESULT:

☐ KEY FOUND: [description of the collapsing insight]
  - What it collapses: [how it fills the gap]
  → Proceed to Phase 5

☐ PARTIAL KEY: [insight that helps but doesn't fully collapse]
  - What it achieves: [partial progress]
  - Remaining gap: [what's still needed]
  → Return to Phase 2 with new information

☐ NO KEY FOUND YET: [current status]
  - Approaches exhausted: [list]
  - Research exhausted: [what's been searched]
  - Most promising remaining direction: [if any]
  → Decision: DIVERGE (wander) or proceed to Phase 4.5
```

---

# KEY-FINDING HEURISTICS

*When stuck, try these in order:*

## The Seven Questions

**1. "What would make this trivial?"**
```
If the problem had property X, it's trivial.
Can I prove it has property X?
Can I reduce to a case with property X?
```

**2. "What's the simplest non-trivial case?"**
```
Solve the simplest version that still captures difficulty.
Does that solution generalize?
```

**3. "What's true that I haven't used?"**
```
List all known facts about the problem.
Are any unused? Why?
Could an unused fact be the key?
```

**4. "What would I need to be true?"**
```
If [X] were true, I could solve it.
Can I prove [X]?
Is [X] actually true?
```

**5. "Why hasn't this been solved already?"**
```
Smart people have tried. Why did they fail?
What did they miss?
What's changed since they tried?
What do I see that they didn't?
```

**6. "What's the dumbest possible approach?"**
```
Sometimes the obvious thing works.
Have you actually tried the naive approach?
Everyone might have overcomplicated it.
```

**7. "What if the premise is wrong?"**
```
What if the conjecture is false?
What if there's a counterexample?
What if it's undecidable?
Seriously consider these.
```

---

# PHASE 4.5: METHOD CONSTRUCTION
*When the key doesn't exist, build it.*

This is the "final boss" phase. Only enter here when you've genuinely exhausted existing approaches and need to construct something new.

## TRIGGER CONDITIONS (v8: includes research requirement)

**ALL must be true before entering this phase:**

```
☐ Completed at least 2 full Phase 2-4 cycles
☐ Gap statement is precise and stable (hasn't changed in last cycle)
☐ Cross-domain search exhausted (5+ domains searched via research)
☐ RESEARCH CONFIRMS: No existing technique solves this gap
☐ Root difficulty classified as "structural" or "fundamental"
☐ You can articulate WHY existing methods fail (not just THAT they fail)
```

**Why these gates exist:** Most problems yield to existing methods. The temptation to "invent something new" is often avoidance of the hard work of finding what already exists. Method construction is legitimate only after you've proven (including via research) the tool genuinely doesn't exist.

**Warning signs you entered Phase 4.5 too early:**
- You can't precisely specify what the tool needs to do
- You haven't tried at least 5 cross-domain imports
- Your gap statement keeps changing
- You're not sure WHY existing methods fail

If any of these are true, return to earlier phases.

---

## 4.5.1 TOOL SPECIFICATION

*What would the ideal tool DO?*

You have the gap statement: "If I could just [X]..."

Now specify the tool that would let you do X:

```
TOOL SPECIFICATION:

Input: [what it takes in]
Output: [what it produces]
Core operation: [what transformation it performs]

The tool must be able to:
1. [capability 1]
2. [capability 2]
3. [capability 3]

The tool must NOT require:
1. [thing that would make it circular]
2. [thing that doesn't exist]

[SEARCH: Does this tool exist anywhere?]
[SEARCH: "[capability 1] + [capability 2]"]
```

**Sanity check:** Is this tool specification coherent? Could it exist in principle? If not, return to dissolution—your gap statement may be wrong.

---

## 4.5.2 PARTIAL TOOL INVENTORY

*What exists that does PART of what you need?*

```
PARTIAL TOOLS:

[SEARCH: "[capability 1] method" / "[capability 2] technique"]

Tool A: [name/description]
  - Does: [what it accomplishes]
  - Lacks: [what it can't do that you need]
  - Gap to full spec: [specific missing capability]

Tool B: [name/description]
  - Does: [what it accomplishes]
  - Lacks: [what it can't do that you need]
  - Gap to full spec: [specific missing capability]

Tool C: [name/description]
  - Does: [what it accomplishes]
  - Lacks: [what it can't do that you need]
  - Gap to full spec: [specific missing capability]
```

**The question:** Can the gaps in these partial tools be filled? Or combined?

---

## 4.5.3 EXTENSION ATTEMPTS

*Can you extend an existing tool to cover the gap?*

For each promising partial tool:

```
EXTENSION ATTEMPT: [Tool name]

Current capability: [what it does]
Needed capability: [what you need it to do]

Extension approach: [how you'd extend it]

[SEARCH: has this tool been extended before?]

Attempt:
[Actually try to extend the tool]

Result:
☐ SUCCESS: Extended tool now covers gap
☐ PARTIAL: Extension achieves [X] but still lacks [Y]
☐ FAILURE: Extension impossible because [specific reason]
```

*This is how Wiles extended Mazur's deformation theory. The tool existed but didn't reach far enough. He figured out how to push it further.*

---

## 4.5.4 COMBINATION ATTEMPTS

*Can you fuse partial tools into something new?*

```
COMBINATION ATTEMPT:

Tools being combined: [Tool A] + [Tool B]

Tool A provides: [capability]
Tool B provides: [capability]
Combined, they should: [full capability]

Interface challenge: [how do outputs of A become inputs of B?]

[SEARCH: have these tools been combined before?]

Attempt:
[Actually try to combine them]

Result:
☐ SUCCESS: Combined tool covers gap
☐ PARTIAL: Combination achieves [X] but interface problem at [Y]
☐ FAILURE: Tools incompatible because [specific reason]
```

*This is how many breakthroughs happen—connecting two fields that seemed unrelated (elliptic curves + modular forms, PDEs + arithmetic).*

---

## 4.5.5 FIRST PRINCIPLES CONSTRUCTION

*Build from scratch based on what the gap requires.*

Only attempt this if extensions and combinations have failed.

```
FIRST PRINCIPLES CONSTRUCTION:

The gap requires a tool that: [specification from 4.5.1]

Existing tools fail because: [specific reasons from 4.5.2-4.5.4]

[SEARCH: has anyone built tools like this?]

Therefore, a new tool must:
1. [requirement derived from why existing tools fail]
2. [requirement derived from gap specification]
3. [requirement derived from problem structure]

CONSTRUCTION ATTEMPT:

Foundation: [what is the new tool built on?]
Core mechanism: [what makes it work?]
Novel element: [what's genuinely new here?]

Sketch of the tool:
[Describe how it would work]

Test on simple case:
[Apply to simplest version of your problem]

Result:
☐ WORKS on simple case → develop further
☐ FAILS on simple case at [point] → iterate on construction
☐ INCOHERENT → return to specification
```

---

## 4.5.6 METHOD CONSTRUCTION SYNTHESIS

```
METHOD CONSTRUCTION RESULT:

☐ NEW METHOD CONSTRUCTED: [description]
  - What it does: [capability]
  - How it closes the gap: [mechanism]
  - Limitations: [what it doesn't do]
  → Proceed to Phase 5 with new method

☐ PARTIAL METHOD: [description]
  - Achieves: [partial capability]
  - Still needs: [remaining gap]
  → Return to Phase 4 key search with new partial tool

☐ CONSTRUCTION FAILED: 
  - Attempts made: [list]
  - Why each failed: [specific reasons]
  - This suggests: [what it implies about the problem]
  → Possible outcomes:
     - Problem may require mathematics that doesn't exist yet (→ Part 3)
     - Problem may be undecidable
     - Gap characterization may be wrong (return to Phase 2)
```

---

## 4.5.7 THE CONSTRUCTION MINDSET

**What separates method construction from method application:**

```
METHOD APPLICATION (Phases 1-4):
"I have a problem. What existing tool solves it?"

METHOD CONSTRUCTION (Phase 4.5):
"I know exactly what tool I need. It doesn't exist. How do I build it?"
```

**The key insight:** By the time you reach Phase 4.5, you should know EXACTLY what you need. The gap statement tells you. The failed attempts tell you why existing tools don't work. Construction is about building to spec, not exploring blindly.

---

# PHASE 5: CONSTRUCTION
*If key found, build the complete solution.*

## 5.1 SOLUTION SKETCH

**Outline the full argument:**
```
Given the key, the solution works as follows:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
...
n. [Conclusion]
```

## 5.2 IDENTIFY TECHNICAL GAPS

```
The sketch assumes:
- Lemma 1: [statement] — Provable? [Y/N/Unknown]
- Lemma 2: [statement] — Provable? [Y/N/Unknown]
- Lemma 3: [statement] — Provable? [Y/N/Unknown]
```

## 5.3 FILL GAPS

**For each lemma/gap:**
```
☐ Proved: [proof]
☐ Hard: [why] → Mini key search on this sub-gap
☐ Existing result: [reference]
```

## 5.4 WRITE COMPLETE SOLUTION

Full solution with all steps justified.

## 5.5 VERIFICATION

**Check:**
- Each step valid?
- Edge cases handled?
- Implicit assumptions identified?
- Could be wrong in a non-obvious way?

**Common failure modes:**
- Implicit assumption that's wrong
- Step that "seems obvious" but isn't
- Gap in case analysis
- Circular reasoning

## 5.6 WRITE-UP

```
SOLUTION REPORT:

RESULT: [statement of what's proved/solved]

THE KEY: [the insight that made it work]

SOLUTION:
[complete argument]

VERIFICATION:
[how you checked it]

CONTRIBUTION:
[what's new]

IMPLICATIONS:
[what else this enables]
```

# PART 2: COMPRESSED ADVANCEMENT PROTOCOL
## Executing Decades of Progress Rapidly

*For AI systems and AI-human teams attacking frontier problems.*

## THE COMPRESSION THESIS

What takes a field 50 years to accomplish:
```
Years 1-5:    Problem formulation + ruling out naive approaches
Years 5-15:   Partial results + foundational lemmas + special cases
Years 15-30:  Cross-field connections + structural insights + frameworks
Years 30-45:  Tool maturation + "almost" solutions revealing the true gap
Years 45-50:  Final synthesis using everything accumulated
```

Each "year" produces **concrete artifacts**:
- Lemmas proved (stepping stones)
- Techniques documented (reusable methods)
- Dead ends mapped (solution space pruned)
- Connections catalogued (cross-domain bridges)
- Tools built (computational/theoretical machinery)

**AI doesn't think faster. AI produces artifacts faster.**

The compression isn't about being smarter—it's about executing the artifact-generation process at high speed through parallelization, exhaustive search, and computational verification.

## STAGE 1: FIELD ABSORPTION

**Goal:** Absorb decades of accumulated knowledge rapidly. Stand where the giants stood, then see further.

**If literature is sparse (nascent field):**
```
If you find < 10 relevant papers:
- Complete Stage 1 quickly
- The "field" is small, so you'll absorb it fast
- Stage 2 becomes more important: YOU map the solution space
- Stage 3-4 become YOUR original contributions
- You're not standing on shoulders, you're building the ladder
```

### 1.1 LITERATURE TRIAGE

```
ACTION: Identify and prioritize ALL relevant work.

Tier 1 (Must fully absorb):
- Original problem statement and motivation
- Major breakthrough papers (changed the field)
- Best partial results (current state of the art)
- Survey papers by top researchers
- Failed attempts by famous mathematicians (their failures are instructive)

Tier 2 (Must understand key claims):
- Supporting lemmas and techniques
- Alternative approaches that didn't pan out
- Computational verification papers
- Connection papers (linking to other fields)

Tier 3 (Skim for coverage):
- Incremental improvements
- Alternative proofs of known results
- Pedagogical treatments
- Historical accounts

OUTPUT: Prioritized reading list
```

### 1.2 DEEP ABSORPTION PROTOCOL

```
For each Tier 1 source:

PAPER: [title, author, year]

Core claim: [precise statement of main result]
Technique: [method used]
Key insight: [what's novel/clever]
Limitations: [where it stops working]
Dependencies: [what it builds on]
Opens: [what new directions it enables]

For techniques:
- Can I reproduce the core argument? [verify understanding]
- Where exactly does generalization fail? [find the wall]
- What would extend this? [identify potential]
```

### 1.3 FAILURE ARCHAEOLOGY

```
ACTION: Deeply understand WHY previous attempts failed.

This is the most valuable part. Famous mathematicians tried and failed.
Their failures contain more information than their successes.

For each major failed attempt:

ATTEMPT: [who, when, approach]

What they tried: [method]
How far they got: [partial progress]
Where it broke: [specific failure point]
Why it broke: [root cause]
What it revealed: [insight from failure]
Could it be repaired? [with what?]

KEY QUESTION: What did they see that made them think this would work?
KEY QUESTION: What did they not see that made it fail?

OUTPUT: Failure map with root cause analysis
```

### 1.4 EXPERT MENTAL MODEL RECONSTRUCTION

```
ACTION: Reconstruct how top researchers think about this problem.

For each major contributor to the field:

RESEARCHER: [name]

Their framing: [how they view the problem]
Their preferred techniques: [what tools they reach for]
Their key insights: [what they contributed]
Their blind spots: [what they might have missed]
Their current position: [what they think now]

Synthesize:
- Where do experts agree? [consensus]
- Where do they disagree? [open questions]
- What does everyone assume? [hidden assumptions]
- What has no one tried? [gaps in collective thinking]

OUTPUT: Map of expert perspectives and their gaps
```

### 1.5 TRUE FRONTIER IDENTIFICATION

```
ACTION: Identify exactly where the field ACTUALLY stands.

The "known" frontier: [what papers claim]
The "actual" frontier: [what's really been proven solidly]
The gap between them: [soft results, believed but not proven]

Strongest results:
1. [result] — Confidence: [high/medium/low]
2. [result] — Confidence: [high/medium/low]

Open problems identified by experts:
1. [problem] — Why still open: [reason]
2. [problem] — Why still open: [reason]

Implicit open problems (not stated but clearly needed):
1. [problem]
2. [problem]

THE TRUE FRONTIER: [precise statement of where progress actually stops]
```

### 1.6 ASSUMPTION EXCAVATION

```
ACTION: Surface the hidden assumptions everyone makes.

Field-wide assumptions (everyone accepts):
1. [assumption] — Justified? [Y/N/Unclear]
2. [assumption] — Justified? [Y/N/Unclear]

Technique-specific assumptions:
1. [technique] assumes [X] — Could X be false?
2. [technique] assumes [Y] — Could Y be false?

Cultural assumptions (things the field doesn't question):
1. [assumption] — Should it be questioned?
2. [assumption] — Should it be questioned?

THE IMPRISONING ASSUMPTION: [which assumption, if wrong, would unlock progress?]
```

### 1.7 STAGE 1 SYNTHESIS

```
FIELD ABSORPTION REPORT:

Field maturity: [nascent / developing / mature / stagnant]
Total literature absorbed: [count]
Years of work compressed: [estimate]

Current state of the art:
- Best result: [statement]
- Best technique: [description]
- Computational frontier: [limit]

True frontier: [precise location]

Why the frontier is stuck:
- Technical reason: [if applicable]
- Conceptual reason: [if applicable]
- The key failed attempts: [list with failure points]

Hidden assumptions identified: [list]
Potentially imprisoning assumption: [the one to question]

Unexploited angles:
1. [approach no one has tried seriously]
2. [connection no one has made]
3. [assumption no one has questioned]

READY FOR STAGE 2: [Y/N]
```

---

## STAGE 2: SOLUTION SPACE MAPPING

**Goal:** Map the entire space of possible approaches, especially unexplored regions.

*You know what's been tried from Stage 1. Now map what HASN'T been tried.*

### 2.1 EXHAUSTIVE APPROACH ENUMERATION

```
ACTION: List ALL possible approaches to the problem.

From Stage 1:
- You know what's been tried → Focus on what HASN'T
- You know the failures → What approaches avoid those failure modes?
- You know the assumptions → What approaches question them?

Approach categories to consider:
- Direct methods: [list all]
- Reduction methods: [reduce to what other problems?]
- Probabilistic methods: [what would a probabilistic proof look like?]
- Constructive methods: [build a solution vs. prove existence]
- Computational methods: [verify, search, optimize]
- Algebraic methods: [what algebraic structure is relevant?]
- Analytic methods: [what analytic tools apply?]
- Combinatorial methods: [counting, bijections, etc.]
- Geometric methods: [spatial intuition, topology]
- Category-theoretic methods: [abstract structure]

For each approach:
- Tried before? [Y/N/Partially]
- If tried, why did it fail? [from Stage 1]
- If not tried, why not? [oversight? seems hard? wrong frame?]
- Potential: [high/medium/low]

OUTPUT: Complete approach enumeration with unexplored regions highlighted
```

### 2.2 UNEXPLORED TERRITORY IDENTIFICATION

```
ACTION: Find the gaps in what's been tried.

From Stage 1 failure map + approach enumeration:

UNEXPLORED APPROACHES:
1. [approach] — Why unexplored: [reason] — Worth trying: [Y/N]
2. [approach] — Why unexplored: [reason] — Worth trying: [Y/N]

UNDEREXPLORED APPROACHES:
1. [approach] — Tried by [who] — Stopped because [reason] — Could push further: [how]
2. [approach] — Tried by [who] — Stopped because [reason] — Could push further: [how]

COMBINATIONS NOT TRIED:
1. [approach A] + [approach B] — Why this combo might work: [reason]
2. [approach A] + [approach C] — Why this combo might work: [reason]

OUTPUT: Prioritized list of unexplored/underexplored territory
```

### 2.3 FAILURE TAXONOMY

```
ACTION: Catalog every failed approach and WHY it failed.

| Approach | Who tried | Year | Specific failure point | What it reveals |
|----------|-----------|------|------------------------|-----------------|
|          |           |      |                        |                 |

Cluster failures by type:
- Technical barriers (method doesn't extend)
- Conceptual barriers (wrong frame)
- Computational barriers (can't verify)
- Structural barriers (math doesn't exist)

OUTPUT: Complete failure landscape with barrier classification
```

### 2.4 CURRENT FRONTIER IDENTIFICATION

```
ACTION: Identify exactly where the frontier is.

The frontier consists of:
- Best partial results: [list with precise statements]
- Most promising open directions: [list with rationale]
- Key lemmas that would unlock progress: [list]
- Smallest unsolved cases: [specific instances]

OUTPUT: Precise frontier specification
```

**Stage 2 Deliverable:**
```
LANDSCAPE REPORT:
- Papers processed: [count]
- Techniques catalogued: [count]
- Dead ends mapped: [count]
- Solution space coverage: [estimate]
- Frontier specification: [precise statement]
- Key blocking lemmas: [list]
- Unexplored regions identified: [list]
```

---

## STAGE 3: LEMMA FARMING

**Goal:** Prove all the small results that normally accumulate over decades.

### 3.1 BLOCKING LEMMA IDENTIFICATION

```
From Stage 2, identify lemmas that would enable progress:

## WHEN TO USE COMPRESSED ADVANCEMENT

**Use this protocol when:**
- Problem is a known hard/open problem with existing literature
- AI has access to computational resources
- Goal is maximum progress in minimum time
- Standard protocol (Part 1) has been attempted

**Don't use when:**
- Problem is novel (no existing landscape to map)
- Limited computational resources
- Problem is simple enough for standard protocol
- You need human insight at each step (collaborative mode better)

**Integration with Part 1:**

```
Option A: Compressed Advancement FIRST
- Use Part 2 to rapidly advance to frontier
- Then use Part 1 for final breakthrough attempts

Option B: Part 1 FIRST, Compressed when stuck
- Use Part 1 through Phase 4
- If stuck after multiple cycles, use Part 2 to systematically expand capabilities
- Return to Part 1 with new arsenal

Option C: Interleaved
- Part 2 Stage 1-2 (absorption + mapping)
- Part 1 Phase 1-2 (orient + dissolve)
- Part 2 Stages 3-4 (lemmas + tools)
- Part 1 Phase 3-4 (assault + key search)
- Part 2 Stages 5-6 (cross-domain + breakthrough)

Option D: Full Pipeline with Mathematical Invention
- Part 2 Stages 1-6 (compressed advancement)
- Part 1 Phases 0-4.5 (dissolution + method construction)
- Part 3 (if barrier requires new mathematics)
```

# PART 3: MATHEMATICAL INVENTION PROTOCOL
## When the Mathematics Itself Must Be Created

*For problems where the barrier is not technique, but the absence of mathematical objects, frameworks, or language needed to even state the solution.*

---

## WHEN TO ENTER PART 3

**Trigger conditions (from Part 1 Phase 4.5 or Part 2 Stage 6):**

```
☐ Part 2 Stage 6 barrier crystallized as "structural" or "fundamental"
☐ Part 1 Phase 4.5 method construction failed because:
   - Required objects don't exist
   - Required framework doesn't exist
   - Can't even state what's needed in current mathematical language
☐ The gap is not "we need a better technique" but "we need new mathematical concepts"
```

**Historical examples of Part 3 being necessary:**
- Newton/Leibniz needed calculus to solve motion problems
- Galois needed group theory to explain polynomial solvability
- Cantor needed set theory to handle infinity
- Grothendieck needed schemes to do algebraic geometry
- Perelman needed Ricci flow with surgery for Poincaré

**The key distinction:**
- Part 1 Phase 4.5: Build new technique within existing math
- Part 3: Build new mathematical objects/frameworks

*Part 3 has its own stage numbering (1-5), separate from Part 2's stages.*

## STAGE 1: MATHEMATICAL GAP ANALYSIS

**Goal:** Precisely identify what mathematical objects, structures, or frameworks are missing.

### 1.1 BARRIER DISSECTION

```
From Part 2 Stage 6 / Part 1 Phase 4.5:

THE BARRIER: [description]

The barrier exists because we lack:
☐ Objects to represent [what?]
☐ Operations to perform [what transformation?]
☐ A framework connecting [what to what?]
☐ Language to express [what concept?]
☐ Axioms capturing [what property?]
```

### 1.2 IDEAL OBJECT SPECIFICATION

```
If the needed mathematical object existed, it would:

NAME: [working name for the object]

Properties it must have:
1. [property] — because we need to [use case]
2. [property] — because we need to [use case]
3. [property] — because we need to [use case]

Operations it must support:
1. [operation] — to enable [capability]
2. [operation] — to enable [capability]

Relationships it must have:
1. Connects to [existing math] via [how]
2. Connects to [existing math] via [how]

THE SPECIFICATION: [complete description of ideal object]
```

### 1.3 FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION

```
If the needed framework existed:

SCOPE: [what the framework is about]

Objects in the framework:
1. [object type] with [properties]
2. [object type] with [properties]

Morphisms/Relations:
1. [relation] between [what and what]
2. [relation] between [what and what]

Key theorems it must enable:
1. [theorem] — which would give us [capability]
2. [theorem] — which would give us [capability]

How it connects to existing frameworks:
1. Generalizes [existing framework] by [how]
2. Specializes to [existing framework] when [condition]
```

### 1.4 GAP ANALYSIS OUTPUT

```
MATHEMATICAL GAP ANALYSIS:

Gap type: [object / operation / framework / language / axiom system]

Precise specification:
[complete description of what's needed]

Closest existing math:
1. [existing concept] — falls short because [reason]
2. [existing concept] — falls short because [reason]

If this gap were filled:
[how it would enable solving the original problem]
```

---

## STAGE 2: HISTORICAL PATTERN STUDY

**Goal:** Learn how new mathematics has been successfully invented.

### 2.1 HISTORICAL CASE ANALYSIS

```
Study each major mathematical invention:

CASE: [e.g., Calculus]
Inventors: [Newton, Leibniz]
Problem they faced: [motion, tangents, areas]
Gap they identified: [no way to handle infinitesimals rigorously]
What they invented: [limits, derivatives, integrals]
Key insight: [approach infinitely close without being there]
How it connected to existing math: [extended algebra, geometry]
Time to develop: [decades]
Time to rigorize: [centuries]

Repeat for:
- Set theory (Cantor)
- Group theory (Galois)
- Non-Euclidean geometry (Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky)
- Topology (Poincaré)
- Category theory (Eilenberg, Mac Lane)
- Schemes (Grothendieck)
- [Others relevant to your problem]
```

### 2.2 PATTERN EXTRACTION

```
Common patterns in successful mathematical invention:

PATTERN 1: Abstraction
- Start with concrete instances
- Identify common structure
- Abstract to definition
Example: Groups from symmetries, permutations, number systems

PATTERN 2: Generalization  
- Take existing objects
- Drop constraints
- See what still works
Example: Non-Euclidean geometry from dropping parallel postulate

PATTERN 3: Unification
- Take disparate areas
- Find common framework
- Build bridge theory
Example: Category theory unifying algebra and topology

PATTERN 4: Construction
- Postulate object exists
- Define its properties axiomatically
- Prove consistency
Example: Complex numbers, transfinite cardinals

PATTERN 5: Necessitation
- Problem forces the math
- Objects defined to solve specific problem
- Theory built around solution
Example: Galois theory from polynomial solvability

Which pattern fits your gap? [analysis]
```

### 2.3 INVENTION PRINCIPLES

```
Principles for mathematical invention:

1. START CONCRETE
   - Work with specific examples first
   - Let abstraction emerge from patterns
   - Don't axiomatize prematurely

2. FOLLOW THE PROBLEM
   - Let the problem tell you what objects it needs
   - The gap specification is your guide
   - Utility over elegance initially

3. CONNECT TO EXISTING MATH
   - New math shouldn't be isolated
   - Find bridges to known territory
   - Use existing intuitions

4. TEST ON SIMPLE CASES
   - New definitions should specialize to known cases
   - Check: does this give right answers where we know them?

5. ITERATE ON AXIOMS
   - First axiom set will be wrong
   - Too strong: nothing satisfies them
   - Too weak: unwanted objects sneak in
   - Refine through testing

6. NAME THINGS
   - Good terminology aids thought
   - Names should be evocative but precise
   - Connect to intuition where possible
```

---

## WHEN PART 3 SUCCEEDS VS. FAILS

**Success indicators:**

- Proof flows naturally once objects exist
- Framework has independent mathematical interest
- Connections to existing math are rich

**Failure indicators:**
- Objects are too ad hoc (solve this problem only)
- Framework doesn't connect to existing math
- Proof still doesn't work even with new objects
- May indicate problem is undecidable or false

**If Part 3 fails:**
```
☐ Problem may genuinely require math beyond current reach

☐ Problem may be false (look for counterexample)
☐ Different foundational approach may be needed
☐ Document everything for future mathematicians
```

# AI-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

*For AI systems using this protocol:*

## Leverage Computational Scale

**In Phase 1 (First Blood):**
- Generate more attempts faster
- Parallelize naive approaches
- Use code to test hypotheses computationally

**In Phase 2 (Dissolution):**
- Generate hundreds of examples programmatically
- Analyze patterns across large datasets
- Visualize structure computationally

**In Phase 3 (Informed Assault):**
- Run many simultaneous attack angles
- Use compute bursts liberally
- Test edge cases exhaustively

## Leverage Knowledge Breadth

**In Phase 4 (Key Search):**
- Cross-domain search across entire training
- Connect to obscure techniques
- Pattern match against historical solutions

## Combat AI Tendencies

**Avoid:**
- Analysis paralysis (tendency to over-explain)
- Premature convergence (accepting first plausible answer)
- Hedging instead of committing to attempts
- Restating the problem instead of attacking it
- Documentation mode (describing instead of doing)

**Do:**
- Actually write solutions, not meta-commentary about solutions
- Commit to specific attempts and see them through
- Track break points precisely
- Return to attempts quickly after analysis
- Pivot when stuck, don't elaborate failure

---

# WHEN THERE IS NO KEY

Sometimes there isn't one:
- Problem is undecidable (no proof exists)
- Problem requires math that doesn't exist yet
- Problem is false (counterexample exists but is huge)
- You're not the one who'll find it (key exists, you won't see it)

**This is still valuable output:**
```

# THE ATTEMPT QUALITY RUBRIC (v8)

**Grade your attempts:**

```
GRADE A ATTEMPT: Fundamentally different approach
- New mathematical framework
- New problem formulation
- Import from different field
- Attack different part of the gap
→ High information value regardless of outcome

GRADE B ATTEMPT: Meaningfully different variation
- Same framework, different technique
- Same target, different angle
- Addressing different failure mode
→ Moderate information value

GRADE C ATTEMPT: Minor variation
- Same approach with small tweak
- Same technique with different parameters
- Reframing without real change
→ Low information value — don't count as "attempt"

GRADE F ATTEMPT: Not an attempt at all
- Analysis without trying
- Documentation of understanding
- Explaining why something might work
→ Zero information value — this is procrastination
```

**Target: 80%+ Grade A/B attempts. If you're doing Grade C/F, stop and pivot.**

# THE META-RULES (v8 Enhanced)

**1. Attempts are information.** Failed attempts teach you what analysis cannot. Don't skip them.

**2. Understanding enables better attempts.** But don't use understanding as an excuse to avoid attempting.

**3. Research fills gaps in knowledge.** You don't know what you don't know. Search before claiming impossibility.

**4. The gap is everything.** Once you can state "If I could just [X]...", you know what you're looking for.

**5. Cross-domain import is underrated.** The key often exists in another field. Search for it.

**6. Persistence beats brilliance.** Keep attacking. The key reveals itself to those who stay in the arena.

**7. But persistence on dead ends is waste.** If 3 attempts fail at the same point, PIVOT. Don't elaborate failure.

**8. Direction matters.** Check regularly that you're attacking the actual gap, not a proxy.

**9. Some problems aren't solvable.** That's okay. Document what you learned.

**10. Documentation is not progress.** Writing about the problem is not solving it. Solutions first, writeups after.

**11. There's often a third option.** When stuck between A and B, look for C.

**12. Diverge when stuck, converge when clear.** Wandering is strategic when directed assault fails.

**13. Research is cheap, ignorance is expensive.** A quick search can save hours of reinventing.

**14. NOs are fast, YESes are slow.** Move quickly past clear impossibilities. Linger where the path is unclear.

**15. The field has tried things.** Before assuming your approach is novel, verify. Before assuming something is impossible, verify.

**16. Artifacts are progress.** Every lemma proved, technique documented, dead end mapped, and tool built advances the field—even without the final solution. Produce artifacts relentlessly.

**17. AI changes the timescale, not the process.** The same work that takes humans years can happen faster—but it's the same work: lemmas, techniques, connections, attempts.

**18. Sometimes you must invent the mathematics.** Part 3 exists because some problems cannot be solved with existing mathematical concepts. Newton needed calculus, Galois needed groups, you might need something new.

*Solutions exist at points where difficulty collapses.*
*Finding those points requires understanding, attempts, research, and strategic wandering.*
*The protocol alternates between them to maximize your chances.*
*Document after finding, not before.*
*Pivot fast on dead ends.*
*The answer might be in a field you haven't looked at yet.*
*Search.*
