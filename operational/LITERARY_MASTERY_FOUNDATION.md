## Core Principles Internalized

### What Makes Great Literature Great

1. **Precision Without Overwriting**
   - McCarthy's "loquacious precision"
   - Hemingway's iceberg theory (1/8 above water)
   - Specific concrete details, but economical

2. **Psychological Depth**
   - Dostoevsky's polyphonic independence (characters not mouthpieces)
   - Faulkner's "human heart in conflict with itself"
   - Character interiority that feels real, not constructed

3. **Moral Seriousness Without Preaching**
   - Theme embedded in action, not announced
   - McCarthy's "profoundly moral sensibility" beneath reluctance to preach
   - Let meaning emerge organically (Lewis's approach)

4. **Universal Through Specific**
   - "Dew-wet daffodils" not "flowers"
   - Concrete details trigger emotional response
   - Generality is death of the novel

5. **Earned Through Building**
   - Emotional moments built gradually
   - No announcements without preparation
   - Trust readers to pick up subtle cues

## Craft Techniques (Quick Reference)

### Show Don't Tell
- Chekhov: "Show me the glint of light on broken glass"
- TELL: "She was tired." SHOW: "She yawned."
- Use showing for important scenes, telling for transitions

### Subtext
- Say one thing, mean another
- What's left unsaid carries weight
- If you explain it, it's no longer subtext

### Sentence-Level Craft
- Short sentences: punch, urgency, directness
- Long sentences: slow down, layer detail, reflection
- Variation creates rhythm (Woolf: "Style is all rhythm")
- Read aloud to catch clunky phrases

### Dialogue
- Each character sounds different (test by removing tags)
- Match background/education/career to speech patterns
- What's left unsaid reveals relationships
- "Great dialogue infers more than it states"

### Pacing
- Rollercoaster: high to low, up and down
- Action needs quieter moments to breathe
- Too much of same pace = tedious

## Children's/YA Fantasy Specifics

### What Works
- Unfold magic gradually (shared discovery)
- High personal stakes (everything feels enormous)
- Boarding school isolation = independent growth
- House system = built-in loyalty/conflict/found family
- Familiar + magical (British school + wizards)

### Child Voice Rules
- IMMEDIATE perspective (no adult hindsight)
- Grade-appropriate vocabulary (not condescending)
- "Eight is BIG" - don't minimize their experience
- Focus on peer relationships over adult relationships
- Use unreliable narrator strategically

### Rowling's Strengths (Copy These)
- Mystery structure (clues, deduction, foreshadowing)
- Meticulous planning (5 years before writing)
- Small-scale intimacy (Hogwarts life, not world politics)
- Humor, contrast, vivid imagery
- Pacing: build-up/rush alternation

### Rowling's Weaknesses (Avoid These)
- Villain monologues, deus ex machina
- Magic as convenient plot device
- Tea breaks during action scenes
- Flat character arcs
- Expanding universe beyond skill

## The Formula

**Familiar Setting + Magical Elements**
+ **Mystery Structure** (clues, foreshadowing)
+ **Meticulous Planning** (timelines, consistency)
+ **Small-Scale Intimacy** (focus on school life)
+ **Gradual Magic Discovery** (rules revealed as needed)
+ **High Personal Stakes** (everything matters enormously)

## Amateur Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Telling instead of showing** (#1 editor complaint)
2. **Info dumping** (character described head to toe on introduction)
3. **Head-hopping** (POV bouncing without scene breaks)
4. **Overwriting/purple prose** (fancy vocabulary hiding lack of story)
5. **Melodrama** (emotion not earned)
6. **Generality** (flowers instead of dew-wet daffodils)
7. **Sentence monotony** (same length/structure repeatedly)

## Plot Structure Options

| Structure | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Freytag's Pyramid | Tragedies, emotional rise and fall |
| Hero's Journey | Transformation narratives |
| Kishōtenketsu | Contemplative, non-conflict stories |
| Fichtean Curve | Fast-paced thrillers |

---

## Sources Researched

- Russian masters: Tolstoy, Dostoevsky (George Steiner, E.M. Forster, Bakhtin)
- American masters: Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner
- Modern masters: McCarthy, Morrison
- Victorian masters: Austen, Dickens, Brontës
- Fantasy world-builders: Tolkien, Le Guin, Lewis, Rowling
- Boarding school genre origins and tropes
- Children's voice techniques

## Writing Test Results (Calibration)

### Sample 1 Results (harsh subagent critique):
- Show Don't Tell: 7/10 → 6/10 (revised)
- Specificity: 8/10 → 7/10
- Subtext: 8/10 → 7/10
- **Child Voice: 4/10 → 5/10** (CRITICAL FLAW)
- Pacing: 8/10 → 8/10
- Mystery/Hook: 9/10 → 6/10 (lost emotion in revision)
- Prose Quality: 7/10 → 6/10
- **Overall: 6/10**

### Critical Weaknesses Found:
1. **Writing ABOUT a child, not AS a child** - third-person limited keeps slipping into adult observer
2. **False precision breaks POV** - "Every 43 minutes" is adult cataloging, not child experience
3. **Emotional hollowness** - Character is a cipher with no wants/fears
4. **Catalog description** vs sensory immediacy (smell, sound, texture)
5. **Theatrical gestures** - "held letter against chest" - kids don't perform emotions

### Fixes Needed:
- Inhabit the POV (experience, not description)
- Give characters wants/fears in every scene
- Replace precision with child-appropriate vagueness ("all the time" not "43 minutes")
- Add sensory immediacy (SMELL the burnt toast)
- Make prose messier/specific to character's brain
- Trust reader (cut "Again" and "same as always")

### Verdict:
Competent apprentice work. Not publication-ready. Must go deeper into character interiority.

## Harry Potter Scholarship

### Character Speech Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Character | Key Patterns | Never Say |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Harry | Straightforward, defensive when accused, sarcastic with Malfoy | Overly eloquent |
| Ron | "Blimey" (books), exasperated, blunt British humor, insecurity shows | "Bloody hell" (film-only) |
| Hermione | Corrects pronunciation, lectures before friendship, precise | Casual/sloppy speech |
| Hagrid | H-dropping ("'Arry"), "yeh/yer/ter", West Country dialect | Standard English |
| Snape | Cold, controlled cruelty, precise cutting remarks | Shouting (until provoked about past) |
| Draco | "My father..." everything, bored drawl, quotes Lucius | Original insults |
| Twins | Finish each other's sentences, synchronized | Speaking alone |

### Hogwarts Setting Essentials

**Great Hall:** Floating candles, enchanted ceiling (sky outside), four house tables, golden plates, food appears magically from kitchens below.

**House Entry:**
- Gryffindor: Fat Lady portrait, password (7th floor)
- Slytherin: Bare wall, password (dungeons, green glow from lake)
- Ravenclaw: Eagle knocker, riddle (tower)
- Hufflepuff: Barrel tap in rhythm "Hel-ga Huff-le-puff" (wrong = vinegar)

**Key Sensory Details:**
- Dungeons: Cold, damp (Potions, Slytherin)
- Gryffindor Common Room: Warm, squashy armchairs, roaring fire
- Filch's office: Smells of fried fish
- Moving staircases: DON'T swing (film invention) - they "led somewhere different on a Friday"

### Rowling's Mystery Technique

**The Formula:** Mystery first, fantasy second. Strip away magic = detective story with clues, deduction, foreshadowing.

**Three-Layer Clue Hiding:**
1. Context camouflage (hide in whimsical elements)
2. Importance inversion (crucial clues seem trivial)
3. Recontextualization (meaning changes after reveal)

**Structure Points:**
- 3/8 mark: First major misdirection
- 1/2 mark: MIDPOINT - shift from reaction to action
- 5/8 mark: Red herring peaks
- 3/4 mark: Final pieces before climax

**Golden Rule:** Twist recontextualizes existing evidence, never introduces new evidence.

### Tone Balance Techniques

**Whimsy-Darkness Balance:**
- Dark moments embedded in lighter contexts (emotional cushioning)
- British understatement on horror ("not the best news Harry had heard all week")
- Rhythmic prose maintains lightness even when content is dark

**Dursley Contrast Function:**
- Privet Drive = conformity, coldness, deprivation
- Hogwarts = warmth, belonging, wonder
- Harry's deprivation makes every kindness land harder

**Morality:**
- Good and evil as CHOICE, not essence
- Surface appearance ≠ reality (Snape appears evil but protects Harry)
- Books 1-2 black/white; Book 3 introduces complexity

### Emotional Beat Patterns

**Christmas as Turning Point:**
- Book 1: Stack multiple "firsts" (first presents, first family gesture)
- Book 2: Use festive setting to heighten tension (somber contrast)
- Book 3: Prolong emotional payoff (Firebolt arc spans chapters)

**Key Technique:** Don't compress emotion into single scenes - let tension build over CHAPTERS.
