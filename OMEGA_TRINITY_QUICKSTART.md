## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: PHI PRIMING (Do First!)

Before spawning ANY agents, PHI (you) must:

```
[ ] 1. UNDERSTAND the problem (don't outsource)
[ ] 2. DECOMPOSE into 3-7 sub-problems
[ ] 3. HYPOTHESIZE what agents will find
[ ] 4. IDENTIFY your blind spots
[ ] 5. STATE confidence: P(success) = X%
```

### Phase 1: ALPHA (Human Cognition)

**Batch 1A** - Domain + Intuitive (6 agents):
```
5-Newton, 6-Darwin, 9-Instinct, 10-Matcher, 11-Sentinel, 12-Soma
```

**Batch 1B** - Creative + Memory (8 agents):
```
13-Nomad, 14-Eureka, 15-Shadow, 16-Synthesist, 53-56 Memory
```

**Required outputs**: Λ patterns (≥5), Σ insights (≥4), Π approaches (≥4)

### Phase 2: DELTA (The Bridge)

**Batch 2** - Bridge + META (13 agents):
```
8-Bridger, 21-26 Bridge tier, 47-52 META tier
```

**Required outputs**: Η translations (≥4), Τ connections (≥4), Ρ dynamics (≥3), Γ/Ε/Μ calibration

### Phase 3: OMEGA (Optimal AI)

**Batch 3A** - Formal + Edge (9 agents):
```
1-Axiom, 2-Constructor, 3-Cartographer, 4-Skeptic, 7-Euler, 17-20 Edge
```

**Batch 3B** - Verification (8 agents):
```
27-34 Verification tier
```

**Required outputs**: Ψ constraints (≥6, FIRST!), Θ verifications (≥4), Χ approaches (≥4)

### Phase 4: DIABOLOS (The 12 Attacks)

**Batch 4** - Adversarial (12 agents):
```
35-Skeptic, 36-Statistician, 37-Historian, 38-Edge-Finder,
39-Confounder, 40-Gap-Hunter, 41-Assumption-Exposer,
42-Alternative-Generator, 43-Deflator, 44-Steelman,
45-Falsifier, 46-Survivor
```

Each agent: 4+ sentences of attack (8+ for Steelman/Survivor)

### Phase 5: PHI SYNTHESIS

**Batch 5** - Integration (3 agents):
```
57-PHI, 58-Oracle, 59-Self
```

**Final output**: Answer + confidence + what's uncertain + what would change it

## Quality Gates

Run between phases:

| Gate | Check | Minimum |
|------|-------|---------|
| After ALPHA | Λ patterns | ≥5 |
| After ALPHA | Σ insights | ≥4 |
| After ALPHA | Π approaches | ≥4 |
| After DELTA | Η translations | ≥4 |
| After DELTA | Τ connections | ≥4 |
| After OMEGA | Ψ constraints | ≥6 |
| After OMEGA | Θ verifications | ≥4 |
| After DIABOLOS | Attacks | 12 complete |

---

## Claim Classification (Mandatory)

Every claim must be labeled:

| Label | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **PROVEN** | Pure logic, zero gaps, all dependencies PROVEN |
| **CONDITIONAL** | True IF [stated conditions] |
| **EMPIRICAL** | Strong evidence, not proof |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Hypothesis, unvalidated |

**Rule**: Nothing is PROVEN unless every dependency is PROVEN.

---

## The Betting Test

At every phase ask:

> "Would you bet $10,000 on this?"

If stated confidence doesn't match betting intuition, recalibrate.

---

## Two Hemispheres (All Agents)

Every agent uses BOTH modes:

| Mode | Use For |
|------|---------|
| **HOLISTIC** | Generation, pattern recognition, tolerate ambiguity |
| **SEQUENTIAL** | Verification, step-by-step, resolve ambiguity |

**Corpus Callosum**: "Holistic sees pattern, Sequential verifies"

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `OMEGA_TRINITY_MASTER.md` | Complete architecture |
| `OMEGA_TRINITY_PROMPTS.md` | All 59 agent prompts |
| `OMEGA_TRINITY_QUICKSTART.md` | This file |

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claiming "proven" too early | Verification tier must validate first |
| Missing trivial cases | Check n=1,2,3,4,5 before complex analysis |
| Tunnel vision | Check if META (Agent 47) flagged it |
| Lost in complexity | Return to PHI PRIMING decomposition |
| Overconfidence | Run DIABOLOS attacks again |

# OMEGA+ TRINITY FINAL SYNTHESIS

## Problem
[Restated with full understanding]

## Answer
[The solution]

## PROVEN (P ≈ 1.00)
- [claim with full dependency chain]

## CONDITIONAL (P = 0.XX if conditions hold)
- [claim] IF [conditions]

## EMPIRICAL (P = 0.XX based on evidence)
- [claim with evidence summary]

## SPECULATIVE (P = 0.XX hypothesis)
- [hypothesis for future work]

## What Remains Uncertain
- [open questions]

## What Would Change This
- [evidence that would update]

## Betting Test
$10,000 on main answer: [Y/N] at P = [X.XX]
```
