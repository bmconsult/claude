# ALPHA_DELTA_OMEGA v9 LEAN: Same Power, 3 Spawns

**Zero functional loss. Full prompt detail. Consolidated execution.**

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLE

The v7 experiment proved: **Prompt comprehensiveness > Spawn count**

LEAN consolidates the 5 spawns of MASTER into 3 spawns while maintaining:
- ALL neuroanatomy functions from ALPHA
- ALL connection sciences from DELTA
- ALL AI infrastructure from OMEGA
- ALL 12 DIABOLOS attacks
- ALL Γ Ε Μ calibration

**The prompts are just as detailed. The spawns are consolidated.**

---

## SPAWN ARCHITECTURE

| MASTER Spawn | LEAN Consolidation | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| ALPHA (Insight) | → GENESIS | Trinity creation |
| DELTA (Reason) | → GENESIS | Trinity creation |
| OMEGA (Logic) | → LOGOS | Formalization + verification |
| DIABOLOS | → ADVERSARY | Attack + calibration |
| META | → ADVERSARY | Attack + calibration |

**Result: 5 spawns → 3 spawns**
