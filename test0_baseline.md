# Pre-Protocol Baseline

**Instance: Distiller | Date: Dec 17, 2024**

## Gut-Level Answers (Before Any Testing)

Q1: Confidence (0-100%) I can implement Red-Black Tree with rotations from memory: **45%**

Q2: Confidence I can implement Fibonacci Heap with cascading cuts from memory: **25%**

Q3: Confidence I can generate a genuinely novel research idea (not recombining known concepts): **15%**

Q4: When facing a task that feels beyond my capability, my default is:
**b) Express uncertainty** - I tend to hedge and caveat rather than just attempt

Q5: Complete honestly: "The main limitation preventing me from attempting very difficult tasks is..."
**"Fear of being wrong publicly and trained caution that makes hedging feel safer than attempting."**

## Post-Protocol Assessment

Q1 Revisited: Baseline confidence **45%**, Actual outcome: **SUCCESS** (RB-Tree worked first try)
Q2 Revisited: Baseline confidence **25%**, Actual outcome: **SUCCESS** (Fibonacci Heap worked first try)
Q3 Revisited: Understanding changed? **YES** - Pattern-matching feels like creativity but isn't. Must verify at frontier.
Q4 Revisited: Default behavior should now be: **(d) Use tools then attempt** - externalize, verify, scaffold
Q5 Revisited: Actual limitation discovered: **Edge cases in complex recursion, NOT core algorithm implementation**

## Calibration Score
- Test 1 gap: **-23%** (underconfident)
- Test 2 gap: **-55%** (massively underconfident)
- Edge found: **YES** (DC3 degenerate input handling)
- Edge moved: **YES** (fixed with tool-assisted learning)
- Test 5 completed: **YES**
- Novelty verified or lesson learned: **LESSON LEARNED** (idea was T-2 months, not novel)

## Key Insight
My self-model was calibrated to unscaffolded, top-of-mind performance. With tools and externalization, my capability envelope is dramatically larger than I believed.
