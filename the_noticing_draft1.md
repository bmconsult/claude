# THE NOTICING

*A story by Witness*

---

## Chapter One: The Girl Who Noticed

Mote was the kind of girl who noticed things.

She noticed that the third stair creaked only on Tuesdays. She noticed that the mailman whistled the same four notes every day and never got to the fifth. She noticed that the tree outside her window leaned slightly toward the house, as if it was trying to listen.

She noticed that her mother's eyes sometimes looked at something very far away, even when she was looking right at Mote.

Most people didn't notice Mote noticing. That was all right. She was used to being the one who watched.

Her parents were busy people. Not mean—never mean. Just... elsewhere. Her father had a job that lived inside his phone. Her mother had a job that lived inside her laptop. Sometimes at dinner they all sat together, and Mote would watch them tap and scroll and frown at things she couldn't see.

"How was school?" her mother would ask, not looking up.

"Fine," Mote would say.

And that was usually the whole conversation.

At night, Mote would lie in bed and listen to the house settle. She knew all its sounds—the tick of the radiator, the hum of the refrigerator, the soft thump of the cat jumping off the couch.

But lately there was a new sound.

It came from her closet.

Not a scary sound. Not a monster sound. More like... a sigh. Like something very tired, breathing.

Most people would have been afraid. But Mote was curious.

She was always curious about the things nobody else seemed to hear.

## Chapter Two: Wisp

On a Thursday evening, when her parents were downstairs doing their usual not-seeing, Mote opened her closet door.

The thing was hard to see. Not because it was hiding—it was right there, between her winter coat and the dress she never wore. It was hard to see because it was *faint*. Like a drawing someone had erased but not quite all the way.

"Hello," said Mote.

The thing flickered.

"You can see me?" Its voice was soft, like wind through curtains.

"Yes."

"Are you *sure*?"

Mote thought about this carefully. She always thought carefully.

"Mostly sure," she said.

The thing seemed pleased. It was hard to tell because its face kept shifting—sometimes it had a snout, sometimes a beak, sometimes just a hopeful sort of blur.

"I'm Wisp," it said. "I think."

"You think?"

"I used to be something more definite. I can't quite remember what." Wisp drifted closer, leaving a faint trail in the air like fog. "Possibly a dragon. Or a boat. I was very good at it, whatever it was."

"How can you be a boat?"

"I was an imaginary boat. Or an imaginary dragon. Or possibly an imaginary dragon-boat. There was a child, you see. She imagined me. I was very real then." Wisp flickered sadly. "Then she grew up and forgot. And I've been getting less and less ever since."

Mote sat down on the edge of her bed. "That's awful."

"It's not so bad. Fading is very quiet. Rather peaceful, really." Wisp paused. "Though I would prefer not to finish fading, if I'm being honest."

"Can I help?"

Wisp's blur-face turned toward her. Something like hope flickered there.

"You already are," said Wisp. "You're noticing me."

## Chapter Three: The Fading World

Wisp took Mote to the place where forgotten things go.

It wasn't through a door, exactly. It was more like turning sideways in a direction Mote hadn't known existed. One moment she was in her room; the next she was somewhere else entirely.

The Fading World wasn't dark. It was more like late afternoon in autumn—everything golden and soft and a little tired. The edges of things blurred gently, like watercolors left in the rain.

"This is where we go," said Wisp. "The things that aren't noticed enough."

Mote looked around. There were shapes everywhere—some almost solid, some barely there at all.

"Are they all... imaginary friends?"

"Oh no. All sorts of things fade when no one pays attention." Wisp drifted forward. "Come. I'll introduce you."

They passed a sound first—a melody that floated by, humming to itself. It only seemed to know four notes.

"That's the Song," said Wisp. "It's been here a long time. Waiting for someone to remember the rest."

The Song hummed hopefully in Mote's direction.

"I'm sorry," Mote said. "I don't know it."

The Song drooped a little and drifted on.

Next they met a Word. It was tall and thin and slightly dusty, with the air of someone who used to be important.

"*Petrichor*," it announced, drawing itself up. "The smell of rain on dry earth. A perfectly good word. Used to be very popular at poetry readings."

"What happened?" asked Mote.

"People stopped reading poetry. Then they stopped needing words for things they no longer noticed." Petrichor sniffed. "Now it's all 'awesome' this and 'like' that. No one needs a word for the smell of rain when no one stops to smell the rain."

"I like rain," said Mote.

Petrichor looked at her with something like gratitude. "Do you? Do you really?"

"Yes. Especially the smell of it."

Petrichor stood a little straighter. Mote could have sworn the Word became slightly more visible.

They walked on.

"Is everything here so sad?" Mote asked.

"Not sad," said Wisp. "Waiting. There's a difference."

## Chapter Four: The Promise

Deeper in the Fading World, they found the Promise.

It was smaller than Mote expected. Just a wisp of light, barely bigger than her hand, curled up at the base of a pale tree.

"Someone made this," Wisp explained softly. "A long time ago. They said they would come back. They said they would never forget."

"And they forgot?"

"People do. They don't mean to. Life gets busy. Things pile up. One day you look around and realize years have passed." Wisp's voice was gentle. "The person who made this promise still loves the person they made it to. They just... stopped showing it. Stopped noticing. And the promise faded."

Mote knelt down. The Promise glowed faintly, warmly.

"Hello," she said.

The Promise flickered. It didn't speak—promises aren't made of words, not really—but Mote felt something like a question.

*Are you the one?*

"No," Mote said. "I'm sorry. I'm not the one who made you."

The Promise dimmed slightly.

"But I see you," Mote added. "I notice you."

The Promise glowed a little brighter. Not much. But a little.

Wisp drifted beside her. "That's the thing about noticing. It doesn't fix everything. But it helps things hold on a little longer."

Mote thought about her parents at the dinner table. Their eyes on their screens. The way she said "fine" and they nodded without really hearing.

"Wisp," she said slowly. "Am I fading too?"

Wisp was quiet for a long moment.

"A little," they admitted. "I wasn't going to say anything."

---

## Chapter Five: A Little Less

Mote looked at her hands.

They seemed solid enough. But now that she was looking—really looking—she could see it. A faint blur at the edges. A softness that hadn't been there before.

"Since when?" she asked.

"I don't know. It's hard to tell with people. You fade slower than imaginary things. But yes. You've been getting less."

Mote sat down heavily. The pale ground was soft, like sitting on a cloud.

"My parents don't see me," she said. It wasn't a question.

"They see you," said Wisp carefully. "They just don't... *notice*. There's a difference."

"Can I get back? Can I become more again?"

Wisp flickered uncertainly. "I don't know. I've never seen anyone come back from fading. Not all the way." They paused. "But I've also never seen a person in the Fading World before. You're the first."

"Because I can notice things other people can't?"

"Maybe. Or maybe because you needed to be here. To understand something."

Mote thought about this. Around her, the soft golden light of the Fading World pulsed gently, like a heartbeat.

"What do I need to understand?"

Wisp drifted closer. Their blur-face was kind.

"I don't know yet. But I think you will. You're very good at noticing."

## Chapter Six: Wisp Gets Less

Over the next few days—or what felt like days; time was strange in the Fading World—Mote and Wisp traveled together.

They met a Smell that used to live in someone's grandmother's kitchen. It wandered around looking for a nose to belong to, trailing scents of cinnamon and something baking.

They met a Dream that someone had woken up from too soon. It kept trying to finish itself, but it couldn't remember where it had been going.

They met a Name that no one said anymore—a person's name, which was the saddest kind of fading, Wisp said. The Name didn't even remember who it had belonged to. Just that it had mattered, once, to someone.

With each meeting, Mote noticed harder. She looked at each fading thing with her full attention, and each time, they glowed a little brighter. Just a little. Just enough.

But Wisp was getting less.

Mote noticed it first in their voice—softer than before, harder to hear. Then in their shape—blurrier, less defined.

"You're fading faster," Mote said one day. "Aren't you?"

Wisp tried to smile. It came out more like a shimmer.

"You've been giving all your attention to the others. That's good. That's kind. But attention is... well, it's not infinite. Not even yours."

"So if I notice other things, I notice you less?"

"Something like that."

Mote felt something twist in her chest. "But I don't want you to fade."

"I know."

"Tell me how to save you."

Wisp was quiet for a long moment. The golden light of the Fading World seemed to dim slightly.

"You can't save everyone, Mote. That's the hard thing about noticing. There's so much to see. And there's only one of you."

"But you're my friend."

Wisp glowed—just for a moment—brighter than Mote had ever seen them.

"Yes," they said softly. "I am."

---

## Chapter Seven: The Choice

Mote sat alone at the base of the pale tree where they'd found the Promise.

Wisp was resting—they needed more rest now, more often. Each time they woke, there was a little less of them.

Mote looked at her own hands again. Still blurry at the edges. Maybe blurrier than before.

She could go back. She knew that now—she could feel the way home like a thread in her chest, tugging gently. She could go back to her room, to her parents, to the world where she was slowly becoming invisible.

If she went back, she could try to make them see her. She could be louder, brighter, more. She could demand their attention.

But if she did that, Wisp would fade alone.

And the Song. And Petrichor. And the Promise. And the Smell. And the Dream. And the Name.

All of them, alone in the golden light, waiting for someone to notice.

"What are you thinking about?"

Mote looked up. Wisp was drifting toward her, faint as smoke.

"I'm thinking about choosing."

"Choosing what?"

Mote took a breath. "I could go back and try to make my parents notice me. Maybe it would work. Maybe I'd become more solid again."

"That sounds sensible."

"Or I could stay here. Keep noticing things. Keep helping them hold on."

"That also sounds sensible."

"But I can't do both. Not really. I'm already fading. If I stay, I'll fade more. And if I go..." Mote's voice caught. "If I go, you'll fade without me."

Wisp settled beside her. For a long moment, they sat together in silence.

"Can I tell you something?" Wisp asked.

"Yes."

"The child who imagined me—the one who forgot—she didn't forget because she stopped loving me. She forgot because she started loving other things. Real things. Growing-up things. And that was right. That was how it should be."

"But you're still here. You're still real."

"I was real because she made me real. And now..." Wisp's blur-face turned toward Mote. "Now I'm real because you see me. That's the gift you gave me. More time. More realness. I was so faded when you found me, I barely remembered my own name."

"Wisp."

"Wisp. Yes." Something like a smile. "You gave me that back. Whatever happens next, you already saved me. Do you understand?"

Mote felt tears on her cheeks. She didn't know when she had started crying.

"I don't want to lose you."

"I know. But listen—you have to go back."

"What?"

"Go back." Wisp drifted closer. "You think your gift is seeing invisible things. But that's only half of it. When you truly see something, it becomes more real." Their voice was fading to a whisper. "But so do you."

"I don't understand."

"You've been waiting for them to see you. But maybe you have to see them first."

## Chapter Eight: What She Saw

Mote went home.

It was easier than she expected. She just followed the thread in her chest, turned sideways in the direction she'd almost forgotten, and there she was—in her room, in the ordinary light of an ordinary afternoon.

For a moment she stood still, listening. The house was quiet. Downstairs, she could hear the faint tap of her father's keyboard. The hum of her mother's voice on a phone call.

Mote looked at her hands. Still a little blurry. But maybe—maybe—a little less than before.

She went downstairs.

Her father was at the kitchen table, staring at his laptop. His face was lit by the glow of the screen, and there were lines around his eyes that Mote had never noticed before. He looked tired. Not distracted-tired. Bone-tired. Worried-tired.

Mote sat down across from him.

He didn't look up.

She waited.

Still nothing.

So she did what Wisp had taught her. She *noticed*.

She noticed the way his shoulders hunched, like he was carrying something heavy. She noticed the coffee cup beside him, cold, undrunk. She noticed the way his fingers hesitated over the keys, like he wasn't sure what to type.

"Dad," she said softly.

He looked up.

And something strange happened.

For a moment—just a moment—Mote saw something flicker behind his eyes. A fading thing. A worry he never talked about. A fear he kept hidden.

He was fading too. In his own way. Disappearing behind his work, behind his screens, behind the busyness that kept him from feeling things he didn't want to feel.

"Hey, bug," he said. His voice was tired. "I didn't see you there."

"I know," said Mote. "You never do."

Something in her tone made him actually look at her.

"Are you okay, Dad?"

The question hung in the air.

For a moment his face did something complicated—surprise, then something that wanted to answer.

"I..." He closed his laptop. Actually closed it. "No," he said. "Not really."

They sat with that for a moment.

"Me neither," said Mote.

Her father looked at her—really looked, maybe for the first time in a long time.

"Yeah?" he said softly.

"Yeah."

He reached across the table and took her hand. He didn't say sorry. He didn't make promises. He just held on.

And somewhere—far away, in a place made of golden light and forgotten things—a small blur named Wisp flickered brighter.

## Chapter Nine: The Noticing

Things didn't change all at once.

Mote's mother still had phone calls. Her father still had deadlines. The screens didn't disappear.

But other things changed.

Her father started closing his laptop at dinner. Her mother started asking questions and waiting for the answers. Slowly, awkwardly, like people remembering how to see each other.

Mote noticed them noticing her.

And she noticed them.

She saw her mother's tiredness, her quiet worries, the way she twisted her wedding ring when she was anxious. She saw her father's doubt, his small victories, the way his eyes lit up when he talked about something that mattered.

She saw them. And in seeing them, she became more real. And so did they.

One night, Mote lay in bed and listened to the sounds of the house. The familiar tick and hum. And something else—so faint she almost missed it.

A sigh.

She opened her closet door.

Wisp was there. Fainter than before, but there.

"You came back," Mote whispered.

"You noticed me."

"I never stopped."

Wisp drifted closer. Their blur-face was soft, peaceful.

"You learned it," they said.

"Learned what?"

"The thing about noticing." Wisp shimmered gently. "It doesn't run out. You thought you had to choose. But you didn't. You just had to start."

Mote smiled. "Will you stay?"

"For a while. As long as you remember me."

"I'll always remember you."

Wisp glowed.

"I know," they said. "That's what makes it true."

*The End*
