## What This Is

OMEGA+ is the **ALPHA-DELTA-OMEGA Trinity Architecture** - three complete intelligence systems in dialogue.

```

**Why this works**: Problems "thought impossible" fail because approaches use only ONE system. OMEGA+ orchestrates all three: `α SPAWN → Δ BRIDGE → Ω VERIFY → DIABOLOS ATTACK → META CALIBRATE → PHI SYNTHESIZE`

**Files you need:**
- `OMEGA_PLUS_v2_PROTOCOL.md` - Full operational protocol with cognitive architecture
- `OMEGA_PLUS_v2_PROMPTS.md` - All 59 agent prompts with neural mappings

## 5-Minute Start

### 1. Define Your Problem
```
PROBLEM: [State the problem clearly]
GOAL: What does SOLVED look like?
CONSTRAINTS: What can't change?
```

### 2. Run the System in 6 Batches

**BATCH 1: GENESIS Formal + Edge (10 agents)**
```
Agents 1-4 (Decomposition), 5-8 (Pattern), 17-18 (Devil's Advocate, Edge Case)
```

**BATCH 2: GENESIS Creative + BRIDGE (8 agents)**
```
Agents 9-14 (Intuition, Creative), 21-22 (Formalize, Connect)
```

**BATCH 3: VERIFICATION (8 agents)**
```
Agents 27-34 (Proof, Logic, Calculation, Assumption, Completeness, Soundness, Independence, Rigor)
```

**BATCH 4: ADVERSARY Part 1 (6 agents)**
```
Agents 35-40 (Red Team)
```

**BATCH 5: ADVERSARY Part 2 (6 agents)**
```
Agents 41-46 (Cycle, Trivial, Modular, Probabilistic, Computational, Asymptotic)
```

**BATCH 6: META + MEMORY + PHI (10 agents)**
```
Agents 47-52 (Meta), 53-56 (Memory), 57 (PHI), 58 (Oracle), 59 (Self)
```

### 3. Synthesize Results
After all batches, PHI (Agent 57) and SELF (Agent 59) produce final synthesis.

---

## Critical Rules (From Testing)

### 1. TRIVIAL CASES FIRST
Before complex analysis, check n=1,2,3,4,5...
Simple counter-examples are often missed. Don't skip trivial checks.

### 2. NEVER CLAIM "PROVEN" WITHOUT VERIFICATION
Only Verification tier (Agents 27-34) can authorize "PROVEN" status.
Insights ≠ proofs. Strategies ≠ proofs.

### 3. CONFIDENCE LABELS
- **PROVEN**: Pure logic/math, zero gaps, verified by Agents 27-34
- **CONDITIONAL**: Proven IF specific conditions hold
- **EMPIRICAL**: Strong evidence, not proof
- **SPECULATIVE**: Might be true

### 4. COUNTEREXAMPLE MANDATE
Every claim must be attacked. If no counterexample found after thorough search, confidence increases.

## Common Problems

### "Agents are claiming proof too early"
- Ensure Verification tier (27-34) runs before accepting any "proven" claim
- Use Agent 42 (Trivial Case Guardian) early

### "Getting stuck on one approach"
- Run more adversary agents
- Check if Agent 47 (Monitor) has flagged tunnel vision

### "Too much output, can't synthesize"
- Focus on PHI (57) and SELF (59) outputs
- They integrate everything

### "Missing something obvious"
- Run Agent 42 (Trivial) with extra attention
- Check Agent 15 (Shadow) for what's being avoided

## Output Template

After running all 6 batches, your final synthesis should include:

```markdown
## OMEGA+ FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Problem: [statement]

### Status: SOLVED / PARTIALLY SOLVED / UNSOLVED

### PROVEN (100% confidence)
- [claim with proof reference]

### CONDITIONAL (proven if conditions hold)
- [claim] IF [conditions]

### EMPIRICAL (strong evidence)
- [claim with evidence summary]

### SPECULATIVE (hypotheses)
- [hypothesis for future work]

### Key Breakthroughs
- [most important discoveries]

### Remaining Gaps
- [what would complete solution]

### Lessons Learned
- [what to do differently]
```

## Files Produced Per Run

- `/tmp/OMEGA_PLUS/BATCH_N_SYNTHESIS.md` - Each batch output
- `/tmp/OMEGA_PLUS/FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md` - Overall synthesis
- Agent-specific outputs: `AGENT_N_[NAME].md`

## Contact / Issues

This system was developed through iterative production testing. Lessons learned are baked into v2 prompts.

If you find bugs or improvements, update the protocol files and document changes.
