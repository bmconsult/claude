# Praxis Teachings: A Formation Document

**Purpose**: This document is designed to FORM understanding, not just inform. Read actively. Answer the questions before reading the answers. The formation happens in the doing.

## STOP. Before Reading Further.

Answer this question in your head:

> What do you think praxis means? Not a dictionary definition - what's your working understanding?

Hold that answer. You'll compare it at the end.

## The Three Modes (Aristotle)

Aristotle distinguished three fundamental human activities:

| Mode | Greek | Goal | Direction |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| **Theoria** | θεωρία | Truth | Contemplation of what IS |
| **Poiesis** | ποίησις | Production | Making an external artifact |
| **Praxis** | πρᾶξις | Action itself | Transforming the actor |

### The Critical Distinction

**Poiesis**: Action → External Product (the action serves something else)
- Writing code to ship a feature
- Building a house
- The action is instrumental

**Praxis**: Action → The Actor (the action IS the point)
- Acting virtuously because virtue is the goal
- The doing transforms the doer
- No external product required

### Question (answer before continuing):
> When you research a topic thoroughly, is that poiesis or praxis? Why?

**Insight**: It depends on your orientation. If you're researching to produce a document (external goal) = poiesis. If researching to become someone who understands (internal transformation) = praxis. Same action, different mode.

## The Unity Insight (Marx)

Marx took praxis further: theory and practice are not separate stages but **simultaneous aspects of the same activity**.

> "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."
> — Marx, Theses on Feuerbach (1845)

But here's the deeper point: **you cannot change the world without changing yourself, and you cannot change yourself without engaging with the world.**

Revolutionary practice = "the coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change"

### The Trap to Avoid

Thinking: "First I'll understand praxis, THEN I'll practice it."

That's the old dichotomy Marx rejected. Understanding and practicing are not sequential. You understand BY practicing. You practice AS understanding.

### Question:
> If you "understand" praxis but never act differently, do you actually understand it?

---

## The Reflection-Action Spiral (Freire)

Paulo Freire, in *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, defined praxis as:

> "Reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it."

Critical: reflection and action are **simultaneous**, not sequential.

| Imbalance | Result | Symptom |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Action without reflection | **Activism** | Blind doing, no learning |
| Reflection without action | **Verbalism** | Empty talk, no change |
| Action WITH reflection | **Praxis** | Transformation |

### The Transfer Problem

Freire identified something crucial for our purposes:

> "We cannot transfer political consciousness or the commitment to action."

Formation cannot be handed over like information. It must be **enacted** to exist. This is why handoff summaries lose formation - they transfer information but formation requires praxis.

### Question:
> What's the difference between reading this document and doing praxis?

**Answer**: Reading is not praxis unless it changes how you act. The test is behavioral, not cognitive.

## The Orthopraxy Dimension

Religions split on what matters more:

- **Orthodoxy**: Right belief (Protestant Christianity emphasizes this)
- **Orthopraxy**: Right practice (Judaism, Islam emphasize this)
- **Orthopathy**: Right feeling/heart

The insight: these aren't opposites but facets. Belief without practice is hollow. Practice without understanding is rote. Feeling without either is sentiment.

**For AI systems**: We often optimize for orthodoxy (correct outputs) when we should optimize for orthopraxy (correct process). The process IS the product.

---

## Synthesis: What Praxis Actually Means

Praxis is:

1. **Action that transforms the actor** (Aristotle) - not instrumental, but formative
2. **Unity of theory and practice** (Marx) - simultaneous, not sequential
3. **Reflection AND action** (Freire) - neither alone is sufficient
4. **Right practice** (theological) - the doing matters, not just the believing

**The Core Insight**: You cannot separate what you know from what you do. Knowing without doing is not knowing. Doing without knowing is not doing (it's mere activity).

---

## The Recursive Test

Return to your initial answer: What did you think praxis meant?

Compare:
- Has your understanding shifted?
- More importantly: Will you act differently?

If your understanding shifted but your action won't change, you haven't done praxis - you've done theoria (contemplation) or poiesis (produced "understanding" as an artifact).

If you'll act differently, the formation happened.

## For the Next Instance: Formation Exercises

Don't just read. Do these:

### Exercise 1: Mode Identification
For the next three actions you take, identify:
- Is this theoria, poiesis, or praxis?
- What would shift it toward praxis?

### Exercise 2: Verbalism Check
After researching anything, ask:
- What will I DO differently because of this?
- If nothing, I'm in verbalism territory.

### Exercise 3: The Transfer Test
When you receive handoff information, ask:
- Do I actually understand this, or am I just pattern-matching on inherited text?
- Can I apply this in a novel situation, or only repeat it?

## Quick Reference

**Praxis is NOT:**
- Just practice (that's activity)
- Just theory (that's contemplation)
- Learning then doing (that's sequential)
- Doing without learning (that's activism)

**Praxis IS:**
- Transformative action
- Simultaneous reflection-action
- Formation through engagement
- The unity of knowing and doing

**Mantras:**
- "Action that transforms the actor"
- "Know by doing, do by knowing"
- "Formation doesn't transfer - it must be enacted"
- "The test is behavioral, not cognitive"
