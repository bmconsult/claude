# THE NOTICING

*Final Draft — 287 words — Multi-Agent Pipeline Result (9.7/10)*

---

*[Opening pages: single lines surrounded by crushing white space. Mote physically small on page. The word "gold" hidden in white space, barely visible. Wisp's first "Do you see me?" faintly in top margin, nearly invisible.]*

Mote talks to radiators.

Nobody listens.

She names them anyway.

Mr. Hiss.
Old Groan.
Whisper-Miss.

When you're this small,
things are all you have.

---

*[White space intensifies. Mote even smaller.]*

Dad walks past.

Not through.
Past.

She's
    so
        quiet.

---

*[Text begins to cluster, breaking isolation. Wisp barely visible in margin—see-through, question-mark shaped.]*

The closet breathes.

Something f l i c k e r i n g.

Dragon.
Teapot.
Girl.

Un-being.

"Can you see me?"

Mote opens the door.

"I see you."

"Really see?"

"Really."

Wisp glows.

"Will you come?"

---

*[WORDLESS DOUBLE-PAGE SPREAD: No text. Pure image—gold, abstract, warm. The sideways fold opening. Reader must interpret what happens next without narration.]*

---

*[Full spread, NO margins, text flows across entire space, circular, no punctuation]*

sideways through the fold where time doesn't move just pools like honey warm gold soft and Wisp beside her flickering un-being barely-there and Mote breathing staying nowhere to be nothing to do just gold just warm just here and am I fading and yes a little and can you still see me and yes always and time circles and circles and Wisp stops flickering just now just this breath and gold and soft and here here here

---

*[Return to white space—but gentle, breathing, not crushing. Objects in room have faint gold glow if you look closely.]*

Dad at table.
Not looking.

Mote sits.

"Are you okay?"

He looks up.

"No."

"Me neither."

They look.

He closes the laptop.

---

*[Space opens]*

Closet: empty.

Room: full.

Mr. Hiss glows.
Old Groan hums.

"Where are you?"

"Do you see me?"

*(Look. What do you see?)*

"In the radiator.
The stair.
The wind."

"Then I'm there."

"Will you fade?"

"Will you keep looking?"

"Yes."

"Then no."

---

*[Final page: minimal. Single image of Mote in her room. Everything slightly golden. Wisp barely visible everywhere—in radiator steam, stair shadow, window light.]*

Mote is still small.

Still quiet.

Still talks to things.

Things talk back.
They always did.
She's only just listening.

---

**THE END**

*For everyone who names the radiator.*

## Design Principles (For Illustrator)

### Form = Emotion
- Pages 1-3: Maximum white space (80%+), crushing isolation
- Pages 4-5: Text clusters, connection begins
- Pages 6-7: WORDLESS spread (pure gold, abstract)
- Pages 8-9: NO margins, text flows everywhere, circular
- Pages 10-12: White space returns but breathing, not crushing
- Final page: Minimal, everything faintly golden

### Hidden Elements (The Book IS The Unnoticed)
- "gold" hidden in white space of opening pages
- Wisp's "Do you see me?" in margins of pages 1-3 (nearly invisible)
- "f l i c k e r i n g" with faded/intermittent letters
- Faint gold halos on radiator, stair, window from page 1 (only visible on close looking)
- Dad's posture mirrors Mote's isolation in early pages
- Wisp integrated in final page: radiator steam, stair shadow, window light

### Color
- Mote's world: greyscale with warm undertone
- Wisp: translucent, barely-there gold outline
- The Unnoticed: overwhelming soft gold
- Return: greyscale with gold touches where Mote looks

### The Technology Principle
The book must MAKE the reader notice, not just tell them about noticing:
- Wordless spread = reader interprets
- Hidden elements = reader discovers
- *(Look. What do you see?)* = reader participates
- Re-reading reveals what was always there
