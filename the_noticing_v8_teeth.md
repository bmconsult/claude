# THE NOTICING
### A Picture Book

---

[Spread 1: Mote in her room, labeling things with sticky notes]

Mote gave names to everything.

The radiator was Mr. Hiss.
The third stair was Old Groan.
The sound the wind makes? Whisper-Miss.

---

[Spread 2: Parents on devices, Mote small in corner, slightly transparent]

But nobody noticed Mote.

*I notice you.*
*Why don't you notice me?*

---

[Spread 3: Closet door, something glowing inside]

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

---

[Spread 4: Wisp revealed - shifting, see-through, magnificent]

"I was a dragon once.
I was a boat.
I was MAGNIFICENT.

But my girl forgot me."

*I notice you,* said Mote.

And Wisp began to glow.

---

[Spread 5: Turning sideways into gold]

"Come see where the forgotten go."

---

[Spread 6: THE UNNOTICED - beautiful but hungry. Things drifting closer, reaching]

Songs no one finished.
Smells from kitchens long gone.
Words no one says anymore.

They pressed close.
They were so hungry to be seen.

---

[Spread 7: The forgotten things surround Mote, pulling at her, desperate]

*Notice ME,* begged the song.
*Notice ME,* cried the smell.
*Notice ME notice ME notice ME—*

"There are too many," whispered Mote.
"I can't notice them all."

---

[Spread 8: Wisp flickering, almost gone]

"Then notice ME," said Wisp.
"Just me. Please.
Before I disappear."

---

[Spread 9: Mote's face. A decision.]

---

[Spread 10-11-12: THE RUMPUS - wordless]

[10: Mote SHOUTS - mouth open, sound visible, everything freezing]

[11: She spins, pointing at EVERYTHING - and what she points at BLAZES into existence]

[12: Chaos. Joy. Terror. Light. Wisp enormous. Mote laughing. The forgotten ROARING back to life]

---

[Spread 13: Stillness. Everything glowing. Mote exhausted but solid again.]

---

[Spread 14: Wisp, bright but sad]

"You have to go back now.
To the ones who don't see you."

"But they'll forget you again!"

Wisp smiled.

"Then notice them first.
Maybe they'll remember how."

---

[Spread 15: Home. Father at table. Phone glowing. Coffee cold.]

---

[Spread 16: Mote sits across from him]

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He looked up.

No one had asked in a long, long time.

"...No."

"Me neither."

---

[Spread 17: The laptop closes. Their eyes meet.]

**I NOTICE YOU.**

---

[Spread 18: Night. Closet door. Empty.]

Mote opened the door.

Nothing.

---

[Spread 19: Mote's face. Waiting. Hoping.]

*I notice you,* she whispered.
*I notice you.*
*I notice you.*

---

[Spread 20: Light begins to gather]

---

[Final spread: Wisp returns - brighter than ever. And behind Wisp, faintly glowing: Mr. Hiss. Old Groan. Whisper-Miss. Everything Mote ever named, coming to life.]

"You came back."

"You kept noticing."

*I always will.*

---

*The End*

---

*For the ones who name the radiator—*
*and the ones who finally look up.*
