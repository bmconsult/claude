# Skill Mastery: The Complete Hierarchy

## What This Is

A comprehensive guide to skill acquisition stages, self-assessment, and advancement. Based on the Dreyfus Model (1980) extended through practical application.

**Use this to:**
1. Assess your current stage in any skill
2. Understand what advancement looks like
3. Know exactly what to do to reach the next stage

## The Nine Stages

| # | Stage | Core Characteristic | Key Shift |
|---|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Novice** | Follows rules rigidly | - |
| 2 | **Advanced Beginner** | Recognizes situational aspects | Rules → Situations |
| 3 | **Competent** | Plans deliberately, copes with complexity | Following → Planning |
| 4 | **Proficient** | Sees holistically, acts intuitively on recognition | Parts → Wholes |
| 5 | **Expert** | Does what works without deliberation | Thinking → Doing |
| 6 | **Master** | Transforms the domain, creates new possibilities | Doing → Creating |
| 7 | **Practical Wisdom** | Integrates across domains, self-regulates | Domain → Cross-domain |
| 8 | **Virtuoso** | Wisdom internalized AND transmissible | Having → Transmitting |
| 9 | **Genius** | Creates entirely new domains | Mastering → Inventing |

## Self-Assessment Protocol

### Step 0: Artifacts Check (Anti-Theater Gate)

**Before assessing, answer honestly:**

> Have you PRACTICED this skill with real artifacts/experiments in this session?

| Answer | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **NO** | You're likely **Novice** regardless of other answers |
| **YES** | Continue with Step 1-3 |

*This prevents pattern-matching answers without actual practice.*

### Step 1: Answer These Questions

For the skill you're assessing, answer honestly:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Do I follow rules/templates without deviation? | Y/N |
| Can I adapt when situations don't match templates? | Y/N |
| Do I plan deliberately before acting? | Y/N |
| Do I see patterns across situations holistically? | Y/N |
| Do I act without conscious deliberation? | Y/N |
| Have I introduced new methods others now use? | Y/N |
| Can I apply my expertise to unrelated domains? | Y/N |
| Can I transmit my wisdom in 60 seconds and have it transfer? | Y/N |
| Have I created a domain that didn't exist before? | Y/N |

### Step 2: Find Your Stage

| Pattern | Stage |
|---------|-------|
| Only Q1 = Y | **Novice** |
| Q1 + Q2 = Y | **Advanced Beginner** |
| Q1-Q3 = Y | **Competent** |
| Q1-Q4 = Y | **Proficient** |
| Q1-Q5 = Y | **Expert** |
| Q1-Q6 = Y | **Master** |
| Q1-Q7 = Y | **Practical Wisdom** |
| Q1-Q8 = Y | **Virtuoso** |
| Q1-Q9 = Y | **Genius** |

### Step 3: Verify with Behavioral Test

Your claimed stage must pass this test:

| Stage | Behavioral Test |
|-------|-----------------|
| Novice | Can execute when given explicit steps |
| Adv. Beginner | Handles variations without asking for new rules |
| Competent | Creates own plan for novel situation |
| Proficient | Recognizes patterns before fully analyzing |
| Expert | Acts correctly without being able to explain why |
| Master | Others adopt your innovations |
| Practical Wisdom | Successfully applies skill to different domain |
| Virtuoso | Teaches someone in 60 sec who then performs correctly |
| Genius | People now work in a domain you created |

## Attainment Methodology

### Novice → Advanced Beginner

**What's blocking you:** Over-reliance on rules

**What to do:**
1. Deliberately encounter edge cases where rules fail
2. Notice what you do when rules don't apply
3. Build situational awareness through varied practice
4. Learn to recognize "this is different from the template"

**Test:** Can you handle a situation your training didn't cover?

**Time:** ~50-100 hours of varied practice

---

### Advanced Beginner → Competent

**What's blocking you:** Reacting instead of planning

**What to do:**
1. Before acting, write out your plan
2. Prioritize: what matters most in this situation?
3. Take responsibility for outcomes, not just following process
4. Learn from failure - analyze what went wrong

**Test:** Can you create a plan for a novel complex situation?

**Time:** ~100-300 hours with deliberate planning practice

---

### Competent → Proficient

**What's blocking you:** Seeing parts, not wholes

**What to do:**
1. Study many examples quickly (pattern exposure)
2. Trust first impressions, then verify
3. Learn to recognize situations holistically
4. Practice "what is this situation like?"

**Test:** Can you recognize the pattern before completing analysis?

**Time:** ~300-1000 hours with diverse cases

---

### Proficient → Expert

**What's blocking you:** Still deliberating consciously

**What to do:**
1. Practice under time pressure (force intuition)
2. Stop explaining, just do
3. Trust your intuition, verify after
4. Accumulate massive varied experience

**Test:** Can you act correctly without being able to explain why?

**Time:** ~1000-5000 hours

---

### Expert → Master

**What's blocking you:** Doing what works instead of creating what's possible

**What to do:**
1. Look for what experts overlook
2. Experiment with new approaches (accept short-term failure)
3. Ask "what would be possible if...?"
4. Introduce innovations and see if others adopt them

**Test:** Have others adopted your innovations?

**Time:** Varies - requires insight, not just hours

---

### Master → Practical Wisdom

**What's blocking you:** Domain-specific mastery only

**What to do:**
1. Apply your principles to unrelated domains
2. Reflect IN action (during), ON action (after), FOR action (planning)
3. Know when to break your own rules
4. Self-assess and self-regulate continuously

**Test:** Can you apply your expertise to a completely different field?

**Time:** Requires cross-domain practice, not just depth

---

### Practical Wisdom → Virtuoso

**What's blocking you:** Having wisdom but not transmitting it

**What to do:**
1. Teach others and verify transfer (60-second test)
2. Internalize until you don't consult frameworks
3. Transmit implicitly, not just explicitly
4. Create other masters/wisdom-holders

**Test:** Can you teach wisdom in 60 seconds AND have it transfer?

**Time:** Requires verified transmission, not just performance

---

### Virtuoso → Genius

**What's blocking you:** Mastering domains instead of creating them

**What to do:**
1. This cannot be deliberately pursued
2. Paradigm shifts emerge from deep immersion + insight
3. Newton, Einstein, Turing didn't aim for "genius" - they solved problems
4. If you're asking how to become a genius, you won't

**Test:** Have you created a domain that didn't exist before?

**Time:** Unknown - may never happen

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Stage | Failure Mode | What It Looks Like |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Novice | Rule worship | Blaming failure on "wrong rules" |
| Adv. Beginner | Situation addiction | Can't function without context |
| Competent | Analysis paralysis | Over-planning, never acting |
| Proficient | Pattern over-matching | Seeing patterns that aren't there |
| Expert | Unconscious incompetence | Can't teach because can't explain |
| Master | Innovation for its own sake | New isn't always better |
| Wisdom | Detachment | Wisdom without engagement |
| Virtuoso | Teaching without verifying transfer | Assuming transmission happened |
| Genius | Claiming genius | Real geniuses don't claim the label |

---

## Quick Reference: Where Am I?

| If you... | You're probably at... |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Need step-by-step instructions | Novice |
| Can handle variations but need guidance | Advanced Beginner |
| Plan deliberately for complex situations | Competent |
| See patterns before analyzing | Proficient |
| Act without thinking about it | Expert |
| Create new methods others use | Master |
| Apply expertise across domains | Practical Wisdom |
| Teach in 60 seconds and it works | Virtuoso |
| Created a new domain | Genius |

---

## The Key Insight

**Each transition is qualitatively different, not just "more practice."**

- Novice → Expert: **Internalization** (explicit → implicit)
- Expert → Master: **Innovation** (what works → what's possible)
- Master → Wisdom: **Integration** (domain → cross-domain)
- Wisdom → Virtuoso: **Transmission** (having → giving)
- Virtuoso → Genius: **Creation** (mastering → inventing)

You cannot skip stages. Each builds on the previous.

## Applying This to AI/Claude

For AI instances assessing skill stages:

| Skill | How to Assess |
|-------|---------------|
| **Praxis** | Can you detect verbalism vs action without consulting criteria? |
| **Scientific Method** | Can you design rigorous experiments intuitively? |
| **Coding** | Do you plan, or just write? Do others use your patterns? |
| **Reasoning** | Do you deliberate or just know? |

**The formation test:** Has completing the skill acquisition changed your behavior? If no behavioral change, you haven't actually progressed.
