# THE NOTICING

Mote gave names to everything—
to the radiator (Mr. Hiss),
to the creaky third stair (Old Groan),
to the sound the wind makes (Whisper-Miss).

But nobody noticed Mote.

Her mother looked at her phone.
Her father looked at his screen.
*I notice you,* thought Mote.
*Why don't you notice me?*

---

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

From the closet came a sigh.

Mote opened the door and found—
a see-through something floating by.

"I'm WISP!" it said. "I was a dragon!
I was a boat! I was a STAR!
But my girl stopped imagining me,
and now look what I are."

*I notice you,* said Mote.

And Wisp began to glow.

---

"Come with me," whispered Wisp,
"to where the forgotten go."

They turned sideways through the air—
and everything was gold.

Songs that no one finished humming.
Smells from kitchens closed and sold.
Words that no one says anymore.
Dreams that woke up before they were told.

*I notice you,* said Mote.
*I notice you,* she said.
*I notice you, I notice you—*

And the forgotten raised their heads.

---

Then Mote began to SPIN—

I NOTICE the song! (it started to SING!)
I NOTICE the smell! (cinnamon BLOOMED!)
I NOTICE the word! (PETRICHOR rang!)
I NOTICE the dream! (a castle LOOMED!)

Wisp blazed like a dragon!
Wisp shone like a boat!
The Unnoticed ROARED back to life
from a single girl named Mote!

---

But Mote grew still.

"I have to go back," she said.
"To the ones who don't notice me."

"Will you forget?" asked Wisp, growing dim.

*I notice you,* said Mote.
*I'll always notice you.*

---

Home.

Her father sat alone.
Lines around his eyes.
Cold coffee. Heavy shoulders.
A phone's pale glow.

Mote sat across from him.
He didn't look up.

So she looked at HIM.

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He stared.
No one had asked in a long, long time.

"...No."

"Me neither."

*I notice you,* said his eyes.
*I notice you,* said hers.

And he closed the laptop.
And he looked.

---

Now, every night—

Mote opens the closet door.
Wisp is there, waiting.
Brighter than before.

"You came back," says Mote.

"You keep noticing me."

*I always will.*

And Wisp glows—
bright as a dragon,
bright as a boat,
bright as everything magnificent
that lives
in the heart
of Mote.

---

*The End*

---

*For the ones who name the radiator—*
*and the ones who finally look up.*
