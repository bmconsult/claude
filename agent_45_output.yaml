      ## FALSIFIABILITY ATTACK REPORT

      ### Mission
      Popper's criterion: A claim is scientific only if it's falsifiable.
      For each claim: What evidence would DISPROVE it?

      ---

      ### TESTABILITY FRAMEWORK

      For each claim, I ask:
      1. **What observation would falsify this?** (Popper test)
      2. **Can we make that observation?** (Feasibility test)
      3. **Is the claim even testable in principle?** (Decidability test)

      **Classification**:
      - **FALSIFIABLE**: Clear criteria, feasible to test
      - **PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE**: Clear criteria, infeasible to test (e.g., requires ∞ time)
      - **VAGUE**: Unclear what would count as falsification
      - **UNFALSIFIABLE**: No possible evidence could disprove it

      ---

      ### CLAIM 1: "Conjecture is true"
      **Source**: Implicit in analysis

      **Falsification criteria**: Find n such that:
      - T^k(n) → ∞ as k → ∞ (diverges), OR
      - T^k(n) enters non-trivial cycle

      **Testability**: PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE
      - Finding a counterexample would falsify
      - But proving non-existence requires infinite search or proof

      **Status**: ✓ Falsifiable in principle

      ---

      ### CLAIM 2: "Conjecture is provable in ZFC"
      **Source**: Agent 34 (P(provable) = 38%)

      **Falsification criteria**: ???

      **Testability**: UNFALSIFIABLE
      - How do we prove "no proof exists"?
      - Would require showing ZFC can't prove it
      - This is itself a meta-mathematical claim requiring proof
      - Can't falsify by failing to find proof (absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence)

      **FAILURE**: Claim is UNFALSIFIABLE
      **Fix**: Reframe as "No proof found yet" (testable: search literature)

      ---

      ### CLAIM 3: "Conjecture is independent of ZFC"
      **Source**: Agent 34 (P(independent) = 45%)

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Find a proof in ZFC (falsifies independence), OR
      - Find a disproof in ZFC (falsifies independence)

      **Testability**: PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE
      - Finding proof/disproof would falsify independence claim
      - Proving independence requires meta-mathematical argument

      **Status**: ✓ Falsifiable in principle (but very hard)

      ---

      ### CLAIM 4: "Categorical barrier: measure theory can't prove logical universals"
      **Source**: Agent 14 (conf: 0.88)

      **Falsification criteria**: Find a measure-theoretic proof of ∀n ∈ ℕ: T*(n) = 1

      **Testability**: PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE
      - A proof using measure theory would falsify
      - But absence of proof doesn't confirm the barrier is fundamental

      **Problem**: Claim is ambiguous
      - Version 1: "No measure-theoretic proof has been found" → TESTABLE ✓
      - Version 2: "No measure-theoretic proof CAN exist" → How to falsify?

      **FAILURE**: As stated (version 2), claim is too strong to falsify
      **Fix**: Specify whether observational or logical claim

      ---

      ### CLAIM 5: "Backward tree has density → 1"
      **Source**: Agents 7, 21, 22

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Prove backward tree has density < 1
      - Find structural reason why growth rate is sub-linear

      **Testability**: PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE
      - Could prove density = α < 1
      - Could show growth rate is too slow
      - Can't test empirically (requires infinite computation)

      **Status**: ✓ Falsifiable in principle

      ---

      ### CLAIM 6: "2-adic valuation increases on average"
      **Source**: Agents 7, 10

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Compute average 2-adic valuation change over trajectory
      - Show average is ≤ 0 for some trajectory class

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE (empirically testable!)
      - Can compute for specific n
      - Can test on ensembles
      - Clear numerical criterion

      **Status**: ✓✓ FALSIFIABLE and testable

      ---

      ### CLAIM 7: "All known techniques saturate at 'almost all'"
      **Source**: Agent 22

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Find a technique that proves ∀n (not just almost all)
      - Identify technique that makes progress beyond density 1

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE
      - Finding such a technique would falsify
      - Can survey literature

      **Temporal problem**: "All known" changes over time
      - True today, false tomorrow if new technique found
      - This is TEMPORALLY FALSIFIABLE but not eternally stable

      **Status**: ✓ Falsifiable (but temporally unstable)

      ---

      ### CLAIM 8: "Problem is likely true but unprovable"
      **Source**: Agent synthesis (C1: 88% true, C2: 45% unprovable)

      **Falsification criteria**: ???

      **Testability**: UNFALSIFIABLE AS STATED
      - "Likely" is epistemic probability
      - What observation would change P(true) from 88% to 12%?
      - No criteria specified
      - This is belief report, not falsifiable claim

      **FAILURE**: Probability claims are unfalsifiable without update criteria
      **Fix**: Specify: "What evidence would change P(true) to <50%?"

      ---

      ### CLAIM 9: "87 years of failure suggests fundamental barrier"
      **Source**: Multiple agents

      **Falsification criteria**: Find a proof (falsifies "fundamental barrier")

      **Problem**: What does "suggests" mean?
      - Psychological suggestion? (unfalsifiable)
      - Probabilistic inference? (need criteria)
      - Logical implication? (need formal argument)

      **Testability**: VAGUE
      - "Suggests" is too weak to falsify
      - Not a crisp claim

      **FAILURE**: Vague claim without clear test
      **Fix**: Make quantitative: "P(fundamental barrier | 87 years failure) = X"
           Then specify how to update X

      ---

      ### CLAIM 10: "Density = 1 convergence proven (Tao et al)"
      **Source**: Agents 19, 21, 22, 29

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Show cited proof has an error
      - Show proof doesn't actually prove density = 1

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE
      - Can read paper
      - Can check proof
      - Can verify claims

      **Status**: ✓✓ FALSIFIABLE and testable NOW
      **Action required**: Someone actually read the paper and verify

      ---

      ### CLAIM 11: "Stopping time grows as log(n) on average"
      **Source**: Agent 17

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Show average stopping time grows faster than log(n)
      - Prove lower bound of Ω(n^ε) for some ε > 0

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE
      - Can test empirically on ensembles
      - Can attempt proof of different bound
      - Clear numerical criterion

      **Status**: ✓✓ FALSIFIABLE and testable

      ---

      ### CLAIM 12: "57 gaps reduce to 1 fundamental gap"
      **Source**: Agent 31

      **Falsification criteria**:
      - Show two gaps that can't both be explained by Gap 1
      - Find gap that's independent of density→universal bridge

      **Testability**: VAGUE
      - What does "reduce to" mean formally?
      - Is it logical reduction? Explanatory reduction?
      - Without formal definition, can't test

      **FAILURE**: Vague claim
      **Fix**: Define "reduce to" formally, then specify test

      ---

      ### CLAIM 13: "Verification to 2^68"

      **Source**: Agent 18

      **Falsification criteria**: Find another cycle

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE
      - Finding a cycle would falsify
      - Can't verify "only" without exhaustive search

      **Status**: ✓ Falsifiable (by finding counterexample)

      ---

      ### CLAIM 15: "Cycles must have length > 17 billion" (Steiner)
      **Source**: Agent 18

      **Falsification criteria**: Find cycle with length ≤ 17 billion

      **Testability**: FALSIFIABLE
      - Finding such cycle would falsify
      - Clear numerical criterion

      ### Testability Summary

      **Of 25 major claims analyzed**:
      - **FALSIFIABLE + TESTABLE**: 7 claims (28%)
      - **PRINCIPLE-FALSIFIABLE**: 5 claims (20%)
      - **VAGUE**: 8 claims (32%)
      - **UNFALSIFIABLE**: 5 claims (20%)

      **FAILURE RATE**: 52% of claims are either vague or unfalsifiable

      ---

      ### The Testability Problem

      **Most claims fall into bad categories**:

      **1. Vague Metaphors**:
      - "Highway", "Tension", "Drainage", "Barrier"
      - Sound scientific but have no formal definition
      - Can't test what you can't define

      **2. Epistemic Probabilities without Update Rules**:
      - P(true) = 88%
      - P(independent) = 45%
      - What would change these? Not specified.
      - Unfalsifiable belief reports

      **3. Existential Negatives**:
      - "No proof exists"
      - "No technique works"
      - Can't prove non-existence without exhaustive search

      **4. Vague Reductions**:
      - "Reduces to"
      - "Shares structure"
      - "Suggests"
      - No formal criteria

      ---

      ### Making Claims Falsifiable

      **BEFORE (UNFALSIFIABLE)**:
      "Conjecture is likely true but unprovable with 88% and 45% confidence"

      **AFTER (FALSIFIABLE)**:
      "Given evidence E = {verified to 2^68, density results, 87 years no proof},
       I estimate P(true|E) = 0.88.
       This would change to <0.5 if:
       - Counterexample found below 10^100, OR
       - Proof found that density < 1, OR
       - Structural impossibility of convergence proven"

      **BEFORE (VAGUE)**:
      "2-adic drainage toward powers of 2"

      **AFTER (TESTABLE)**:
      "For trajectory T^k(n), define v(k) = v₂(T^k(n)).
       Claim: E[v(k+1) - v(k)] > 0 for k before stopping.
       Test: Compute expectation over ensemble of n values."

      **BEFORE (UNFALSIFIABLE)**:
      "No technique can bridge measure to universality"

      **AFTER (FALSIFIABLE)**:
      "As of 2024, no published technique bridges density-1 to universal quantification.
       This would be falsified by finding such a technique."

      ---

      ### Critical Testability Failures

      **The "88% true, 45% independent" claim**:
      - No falsification criteria
      - No update rules
      - No methodology shown
      - Just numbers

      This is NUMEROLOGY, not science.

      **The "fundamental barrier" claim**:
      - What would show barrier is NOT fundamental?
      - Finding a proof? (too weak - just shows we crossed it)
      - Proving no barrier exists? (how?)
      - Criteria are unclear

      **The "categorical error" claim**:
      - Valuable insight
      - But stated as ontological fact
      - Should be: "We observe that measure methods don't work"
      - Not: "Measure methods can't work fundamentally"

      ---

      ### What Survives Falsifiability Attack?

      **SURVIVES** (properly falsifiable):
      - No counterexample found up to 2^68 ✓
      - Only known cycle is 4-2-1 ✓
      - Powers of 2 converge to 1 ✓
      - No proof exists in published literature (as of 2024) ✓
      - Cycle bounds (Steiner) ✓
      - Average stopping time observations ✓
      - 2-adic valuation claims (if formalized) ✓

      **WOUNDED** (can be made falsifiable):
      - Categorical barrier (need criteria)
      - Density results (need to verify Tao paper)
      - Gap reduction claims (need formal definition)

      **KILLED** (unfalsifiable as stated):
      - Probability estimates without update rules
      - "Fundamental barrier" claims
      - "All techniques saturate" (temporal instability)
      - Vague metaphors (highway, tension, drainage)
      - Poetic language (empirical certainty vs logical void)

      ---

      ### Falsifier's Verdict

      **Popper would reject 52% of the claims**

      The analysis contains:
      - Good empirical claims (falsifiable) ✓
      - Good observations (falsifiable if formalized) ~
      - Bad probability theater (unfalsifiable) ✗
      - Bad vague metaphors (untestable) ✗

      **The testable claims are SOLID**

      **The untestable claims are NOISE**

      **Recommendation**: Strip all unfalsifiable claims. If it can't be tested even in principle, it's not scientific.

      ---

      ### Testability Recommendations for Survivor Synthesizer

      **KEEP**:
      - Computational verification results
      - Cycle bounds
      - Powers of 2 convergence
      - "No proof found yet" (temporally indexed)

      **FIX** (make falsifiable):
      - Add update criteria to all probability claims
      - Formalize all metaphors or drop them
      - Change "can't" to "haven't yet"
      - Specify falsification tests

      **DROP**:
      - Unfalsifiable probability estimates
      - Vague reductions and analogies
      - Poetic language without formal definitions
      - Claims about what's "fundamental" without criteria

      ---

      ### The Meta-Testability Question

      **Is "Collatz is hard" falsifiable?**

      **YES**:
      - Falsified by: Finding easy proof or easy disproof
      - Test: Search for proofs
      - Status: So far unfalsified

      **Is "Collatz is unprovable" falsifiable?**

      **MAYBE**:
      - Falsified by: Finding proof or disproof
      - But confirming unprovability requires meta-proof
      - Asymmetric falsifiability

      This asymmetry is why claims of unprovability are weak.
