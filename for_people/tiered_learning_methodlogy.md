## **TIER 1 \- INPUT (Acquisition)**

**Core Question:** How do you get high-fidelity information from the external world into your cognitive system, efficiently and accurately?

**Why This Tier Matters:** Everything downstream depends on input quality. Garbage in, garbage out. Most people operate at maybe 20-30% input efficiency \- they read slowly, listen passively, observe casually, and encode poorly. Mastering this tier alone would give you a 3-5x advantage.

  * Inferential (what does it imply?)  
  * Critical (is it true? what's missing?)  
* **Adaptive Reading** → Right mode for right purpose

**Sub-skills:**

* Vocabulary acquisition (the rate-limiter for most people)  
* Syntactic parsing (following complex sentence structures)  
* Genre recognition (reading a contract vs. a novel vs. a research paper)

**Mastery Indicator:** You regularly notice things others miss. You can walk into a room and within 30 seconds have a read on dynamics, status hierarchies, and what's off.

---

### **1.4 QUESTIONING**

* Dual coding (words \+ visuals)  
* Chunking (grouping related items)

**Mastery Indicator:** You have a system. Information you encounter gets processed into a form you can retrieve and use. Nothing important falls through the cracks.

---

## **TIER 2 \- REPRESENTATION (Modeling)**

**Core Question:** How do you structure and organize information internally so it's available for reasoning?

**Why This Tier Matters:** Input without structure is noise. Tier 2 is where information becomes *knowledge* \- organized, connected, usable. The quality of your thinking is bounded by the quality of your representations.

                 Concept  
                 Category  
                 Specific instance

Most Concrete:   Sensory particular

## **TIER 3 \- PROCESSING (Reasoning)**

**Core Question:** How do you operate on your representations to generate new knowledge, conclusions, and insights?

**Why This Tier Matters:** Tiers 1-2 give you material. Tier 3 is the machinery that transforms it. This is where actual *thinking* happens \- the operations that distinguish rigorous cognition from vibes and hunches.

---

### **3.1 DEDUCTIVE REASONING**

Deriving certain conclusions from premises. If the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion MUST be true.

**Progression:**

* **Following deductions** → Can you track an argument?  
* **Evaluating validity** → Is the form correct?  
* **Evaluating soundness** → Are the premises actually true?  
* **Constructing deductions** → Building your own valid arguments

**Sub-skills:**

* Syllogistic reasoning (All A are B, X is A, therefore X is B)  
* Conditional reasoning (If P then Q; P; therefore Q)  
* Recognizing invalid forms (affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent)  
* Reductio ad absurdum (proving by contradiction)  
* Chain arguments (if A→B and B→C, then A→C)

**Core Valid Forms:**

| Name | Structure | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Modus Ponens | If P then Q; P; ∴ Q | If it rains, ground is wet. It rains. ∴ Ground is wet. |
| Modus Tollens | If P then Q; not Q; ∴ not P | If it rains, ground is wet. Ground is dry. ∴ It didn't rain. |
| Disjunctive Syllogism | P or Q; not P; ∴ Q | It's Monday or Tuesday. Not Monday. ∴ Tuesday. |
| Hypothetical Syllogism | If P then Q; if Q then R; ∴ if P then R | Chained conditionals |

**Mastery Indicator:** You can identify the logical structure of arguments in natural language. You catch invalid reasoning automatically, including your own. You can construct airtight deductive cases.

| Argument | What's the structure? Are premises true? Is it valid? |
| Evidence | How was this gathered? What's the sample? What's missing? |
| Claim | What would make this false? What's the base rate? |

**Common Fallacies to Catch:**

---

## **TIER 4 \- META-COGNITION (Regulation)**

**Core Question:** How do you monitor and control your own cognitive processes?

**Why This Tier Matters:** Tiers 1-3 are the machinery. Tier 4 is the operator \- the ability to observe, direct, and optimize your own cognition. Without it, you can't improve systematically. This is what separates good learners from great ones.

| Retrieval methods | Finding what you need (search, browse, links) |
| Review rhythms | Keeping knowledge fresh |

**System Design Principles:**

* Friction-free capture (make it easy or you won't do it)  
* Process regularly (raw notes decay)  
* Connect aggressively (isolated knowledge is less useful)  
* Retrieve actively (don't just store, use)  
* Prune ruthlessly (obsolete knowledge is clutter)

**Mastery Indicator:** You have a system that works for you. Important knowledge doesn't get lost. You can find what you learned years ago. Your knowledge compounds.
