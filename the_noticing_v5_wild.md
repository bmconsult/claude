# THE NOTICING

Mote collected sounds in a little book—
the tink of the radiator, the creak of the stair.
She tried to show her mother. Her mother didn't look.
She called to her father. Her father wasn't there.

*Mote, Mote, speck of dust!*
*Shout if you have to!*
*Shout if you must!*

So Mote SHOUTED.

She banged on the table! She stomped on the floor!
She yelled "LOOK AT ME!" till her throat was sore!

Her father looked up—
and looked back at his phone.
And Mote felt herself fading.
Alone.

---

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

From the closet. A sound like a sigh.

Mote opened the door—
and found something see-through.
"I'm WISP," said the something.
"And I was like you.

I was dragon! I was boat!
I was MAGNIFICENT, once!
But my girl grew up and stopped imagining—
and now I'm almost none."

"Can I help?" whispered Mote.

Wisp flickered and glowed:
"Come sideways with me—
to the place that the forgotten go."

---

The Unnoticed was gold.
Gold and soft and still.
They walked through a field
of half-remembered things.

*A song drifted by—*
*doo-dee-doo-DUM!*
*doo-dee-doo-DUM!*
*doo-dee-doo—*
*(she forgot how it goes)*

And a smell floated past—
cinnamon, baking—
looking for a kitchen
that was torn down long ago.

"Wisp," Mote said slowly.
"Am I fading too?"

Wisp was quiet.
Too quiet.

"Yes."

---

Then something WILD rose up in Mote.

"NO!" she shouted.
And she ran through the gold!
Through the half-things and almost-things!
Through forgotten and old!

She spun! She leaped! She noticed EVERYTHING—
the songs and the smells and the words on the wind!

*And Wisp began to glow.*

"What are you DOING?" cried Wisp, getting brighter.

"NOTICING!" yelled Mote. "I'M NOTICING EVERYTHING!
Look at THAT! Look at THIS! Look at YOU, you beautiful thing!"

And all through the Unnoticed,
the forgotten began to glow—
the songs and the smells and the half-finished dreams
that nobody remembered
started
to
GROW.

---

But Mote grew tired.

She couldn't notice forever.
And when she stopped...
Wisp began to fade.

"No," whispered Mote. "NO!"

Wisp smiled—soft and see-through.
"You have to go back now.
To the people who aren't noticing you."

"But you'll disappear!"

"Maybe," said Wisp.
"Or maybe...
you'll remember me every day.
And that will be enough.
*That's how noticing works.*
*It goes both ways.*"

---

Mote went home.

Her father sat with his phone.
Lines around his eyes.
Cold coffee.
Heavy shoulders.

Mote sat down across from him.
He didn't look up.

So she looked at *him*.
Really looked.

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He stared at her.
Nobody had asked in a long, long time.

"...No," he said. "I'm not."

"Me neither."

And then—

He closed the laptop.
And he *looked.*

---

Things didn't get perfect.

But sometimes now—
Dad closes his eyes and listens.
Mom puts down her phone.
They ask questions
and wait for the answer.

And every night, Mote opens her closet.
And Wisp is there.
Fainter some days.
Brighter on others.

"You came back," says Mote.

"You keep noticing me," says Wisp.

"I always will."

And Wisp glows—
for just one moment—
bright as a dragon.
Bright as a boat.
Bright as something
MAGNIFICENT.

*The End*

---

*For the specks of dust in sunbeams—*
*and the ones who finally looked up.*
