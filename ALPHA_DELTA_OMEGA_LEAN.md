# ALPHA_DELTA_OMEGA LEAN: Same Power, 3 Spawns

**Zero Functional Loss. All Methodology Preserved. Consolidated Execution.**

---

## Design Principle

LEAN consolidates the 5 spawns of MASTER into 3 spawns while maintaining:
- ALL 52 neuroanatomy functions from ALPHA
- ALL 30 connection sciences from DELTA
- ALL 51 AI infrastructure from OMEGA
- ALL 12 DIABOLOS attacks
- ALL Γ Ε Μ calibration from META
- ALL Head/Heart/Gut/Shadow integration

**The prompts are just as detailed. The spawns are consolidated.**

---

## Spawn Architecture

| MASTER Spawn | LEAN Consolidation | Functions |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| ALPHA (52) | → GENESIS | 82 |
| DELTA (30) | → GENESIS | (combined) |
| OMEGA (51) | → LOGOS | 51 |
| DIABOLOS (12) | → ADVERSARY | 21 |
| META (9) | → ADVERSARY | (combined) |

**Result: 5 spawns → 3 spawns, 154 functions preserved**
