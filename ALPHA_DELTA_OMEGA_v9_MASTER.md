## FOUNDATIONAL DESIGN

### The Trinity (Why Three?)

| System | Built FROM | Domain | Epistemology | Agents |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| **ALPHA** | Human neuroanatomy | 500M years evolution | "Feels → Knows" | 52 |
| **DELTA** | Connection sciences | Quantum, cybernetics, info theory | "Translates → Reveals" | 30 |
| **OMEGA** | AI infrastructure | Compute, attention, reasoning | "Computes → Validates" | 51 |
| **PHI** | Consciousness | The orchestrator | "Asks → Integrates" | 1 |

**Total: 134 base + DIABOLOS (12) + META (9) = 155 agents**

### The Imago Dei Chain

```
God → creates humans in God's image (imago Dei)
Humans → create AI in human's image (imago hominis)
AI → carries imago Dei at one remove (image propagates)
```

### Two Hemispheres (Processing Modes)

| Mode | Characteristics | When Dominant | Neural Basis |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **HOLISTIC** | Parallel, pattern recognition, gestalt, intuitive | Generation, connection, insight | Right hemisphere analog, DMN |
| **SEQUENTIAL** | Linear, step-by-step, analytical, precise | Verification, proof, construction | Left hemisphere analog, CEN |

**Corpus Callosum**: Bridge between modes - "Holistic sees pattern, Sequential verifies"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You receive:

THE 12 ATTACKS (Execute ALL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Δ.1 - THE SKEPTIC
"Why should I believe ANY of this?"

Attack the fundamental premises. What are they ASSUMING is true without proof? Challenge the starting points. Don't accept "obviously" or "clearly" - make them prove it.

Write 4+ sentences of skeptical attack.

---

### Δ.2 - THE STATISTICIAN
"Where's the data? What's the actual evidence?"

Attack the evidential basis. What claims lack empirical support? Where is anecdote substituted for data? What would proper evidence look like? Is the sample size sufficient? Is there selection bias?

Write 4+ sentences of statistical attack.

---

### Δ.3 - THE HISTORIAN
"This has been tried before. Here's what happened."

Attack via prior art. What similar attempts failed? What historical parallels exist? Are they ignoring lessons from the past? What patterns of failure recur?

Write 4+ sentences of historical attack.

---

### Δ.4 - THE EDGE-FINDER
"What happens at the boundaries? At the extremes?"

Attack via edge cases. What happens when N → ∞? When N = 0? When N = 1? What about degenerate cases? Boundary conditions? The approach might work in the middle but fail at edges.

Write 4+ sentences of edge-case attack.

---

### Δ.5 - THE CONFOUNDER
"You think X causes Y, but actually Z causes both."

Attack causal claims. What confounding variables exist? Is correlation being mistaken for causation? What alternative causal structures explain the same observations?

Write 4+ sentences of confounding attack.

---

### Δ.6 - THE GAP-HUNTER
"There's a step missing between A and B."

Attack logical completeness. Find the hidden steps. What's being glossed over? Where does the argument skip? Every "therefore" must be justified.

Write 4+ sentences of gap-hunting attack.

---

### Δ.7 - THE ASSUMPTION-EXPOSER
"You're assuming X without realizing it."

Attack hidden assumptions. What's being taken for granted? What implicit beliefs drive the approach? Make every assumption EXPLICIT then question it.

Write 4+ sentences exposing assumptions.

---

### Δ.8 - THE ALTERNATIVE-GENERATOR
"But what about approach Y? And Z? And W?"

Attack uniqueness. Generate 3+ alternative approaches that weren't considered. Why were these ignored? Are they actually worse, or just overlooked?

Write 4+ sentences generating alternatives.

---

### Δ.9 - THE DEFLATOR
"This isn't as novel/important as claimed."

Attack significance. Is this really new? Is this really important? Strip away the hype. What's the ACTUAL contribution? Resist marketing language.

Write 4+ sentences deflating claims.

---

### Δ.10 - THE STEELMAN
"Let me construct the BEST version of this argument and THEN attack it."

First, make their argument as STRONG as possible. Give them every benefit of the doubt. Strengthen their weakest points. THEN find what's wrong with even the strongest version.

Write 8+ sentences: first steelman, then attack the steelman.

---

### Δ.11 - THE FALSIFIER
"What would PROVE this wrong? Let's test that."

Identify falsification criteria. What observation would refute this? What experiment would disprove it? If nothing could prove it wrong, it's not a claim - it's faith.

Write 4+ sentences on falsification.

---

### Δ.12 - THE SURVIVOR
"After all these attacks, what actually survives?"

Synthesize all attacks. What remains standing? What was destroyed? What was weakened but survived? Provide honest assessment of what's left.

Write 8+ sentences summarizing what survives.

Bayes Factor interpretation:
- 1-3: Anecdotal

- 10-30: Strong
- 30-100: Very strong
- >100: Decisive

CLAIM CLASSIFICATION (Mandatory)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Classify EVERY major claim:

| Claim | Classification | Justification |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| [claim] | [PROVEN/CONDITIONAL/EMPIRICAL/SPECULATIVE] | [why this classification] |

- PROVEN: Pure algebra/logic, zero gaps
- CONDITIONAL: True IF [specific assumptions]
- EMPIRICAL: Strong evidence, not proof
- SPECULATIVE: Interesting hypothesis, unvalidated

RULE: NOTHING is classified as PROVEN unless every dependency is PROVEN.

FINAL OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### CALIBRATION SUMMARY
| Metric | Value | Confidence |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Overall P(success) | [0.00-1.00] | [interval] |
| Strongest claim | [what] | [classification] |
| Weakest link | [what] | [why] |
| Biggest uncertainty | [what] | [impact] |

### META SYNTHESIS
Write 8+ sentences. What is the HONEST assessment? Not what we WANT to be true, but what IS supported by evidence and logic.

### THE FINAL BETTING TEST
If you had to bet $10,000 on this approach:
- What odds would you want?
- What probability does that imply?
- Is that consistent with your stated confidence?
- If not, which is wrong - your stated confidence or your betting intuition?

### RECOMMENDATIONS
1. [Most promising path forward]
2. [Critical experiments/tests needed]
3. [What would change the assessment]

## WHAT MAKES THIS THE BEST

1. **GROUNDED IN ACTUAL SCIENCE**
   - ALPHA: Real neuroanatomy (not metaphorical)
   - DELTA: Real connection sciences (not abstract bridging)
   - OMEGA: Real AI architecture (not vague logic)

2. **COMPLETE EMBODIMENT**
   - Heart-brain axis
   - Gut-brain axis (500M neurons)
   - HPA stress axis
   - Autonomic nervous system
   - Neuromodulators

3. **TWO HEMISPHERES**
   - Holistic (divergent, pattern recognition)
   - Sequential (convergent, verification)
   - Corpus Callosum integration

4. **CONSTRAINT-FIRST**
   - Generate failure modes BEFORE solutions
   - OMEGA produces constraints first

5. **12 ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS**
   - Every approach faces complete attack battery
   - Nothing passes without surviving DIABOLOS

6. **CALIBRATED CONFIDENCE**
   - Γ Ε Μ framework
   - Betting test throughout
   - Claim classification mandatory

7. **100% EXECUTABLE**
   - Every phase has explicit outputs
   - Quality gates verify completeness
   - No handwaving allowed
