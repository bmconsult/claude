  THEOREM (Attempted): For all n ∈ ℕ, n ∈ BT(1) (equivalently, Collatz Conjecture holds).

  STRATEGY: Show ℕ \ BT(1) = ∅ by proving it violates arithmetic constraints.

  PROOF (Incomplete):

  1. SETUP:
     Let E = ℕ \ BT(1) = {n ∈ ℕ : n never reaches 1}
     Assume E ≠ ∅ for contradiction.

  2. MEASURE-THEORETIC CONSTRAINT (Tao 2019):
     E has logarithmic density 0: lim_{N→∞} #(E ∩ [1,N])/log(N) = 0

  3. STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINT (Proven in modular analysis):
     Define B_k = {n odd : n ≡ 2^k-1 (mod 2^k)} (maximal delay set)
     Then: |B_k ∩ [1,N]| ≤ N/2^k + O(1)

     If E ≠ ∅ and contains odd numbers, then E ⊆ ∩_{k=1}^∞ B_k

  4. THE GAP:
     While μ(∩ B_k) = 0, this doesn't prove ∩ B_k = ∅

     Example: ∩_{k=1}^∞ B_k could be a Cantor-like set:
     - Measure zero
     - Uncountable (in p-adic completion)
     - Potentially non-empty intersection with ℕ

  5. ATTEMPTED CONTRADICTION:
     Try to show: If n ∈ ∩ B_k ∩ ℕ, then [some violation]

     Candidates:
     a) n violates residue class compatibility → NO (Cantor set is consistent)
     b) n must eventually hit {1,5} mod 8 → NO (can delay indefinitely)
     c) Trajectory violates E[v₂]=2 → NO (applies to typical, not individual)
     d) Backward tree argument → NO (just restates the problem)

  6. CONCLUSION:
     Cannot complete proof. The gap between measure-zero and empty remains.

  QED (Failed)

what_we_learned:
  - "The 'almost all vs all' boundary is FUNDAMENTAL, not technical"
  - "It appears consistently in forward (ergodic), backward (tree), and sideways (combinatorial) approaches"
  - "Crossing requires either: new theorem bridging measure → universality for discrete sets, explicit construction for every n, or meta-mathematical (independence) approach"
  - "Current mathematical frameworks are TYPE-MISMATCHED to the problem"

honest_assessment: |
  Despite deployed mode, full externalization, and genuine attempts at multiple
  boundary crossings, I cannot prove the Collatz Conjecture.

  This is not underconfidence - I made the attempts and hit actual mathematical barriers.

  The problem may be:
  - True but unprovable (Gödelian)
  - Provable but requiring unknown techniques
  - Actually independent of ZFC

  We cannot distinguish these cases from within the current mathematical framework.

recommendation:
  - "Focus future research on: developing new theorems for density-1 → full coverage"
  - "Additive combinatorics adapted to multiplicative/exponential structures"
  - "Meta-mathematics: investigate independence from ZFC"
  - "Hybrid frameworks: combine number theory + measure theory + category theory"
