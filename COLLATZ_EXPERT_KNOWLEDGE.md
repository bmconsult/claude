## 1. Lifting the Exponent (LTE) Lemma

### Statements

**Odd prime p**: If p | (x-y) and p ∤ xy:
```
v_p(x^n - y^n) = v_p(x - y) + v_p(n)
```

**p = 2**: If x, y are both odd:
```
v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y) + v_2(x + y) + v_2(n) - 1  [n even]
v_2(x^n - y^n) = v_2(x - y)                            [n odd]
```

### Application to Collatz

For 3^k - 1 (x=3, y=1):
- **k odd**: v_2(3^k - 1) = 1 (only one factor of 2!)
- **k even**: v_2(3^k - 1) = 2 + v_2(k)

**Why this matters**: Growth phases can only extract limited 2-powers from 3^k terms.
Even for k = 2^20 (over a million), v_2(3^k - 1) = 2 + 20 = 22. Logarithmic growth!

This is the **rigorous foundation** for growth self-limitation.

## 2. Mihailescu's Techniques (Catalan Proof)

### Key ingredients

1. **Cyclotomic fields** Q(ζ_p) - not transcendence methods!
2. **Stickelberger's theorem** - Stickelberger ideal annihilates class group
3. **Double Wieferich condition** - p^{q-1} ≡ 1 (mod q²) AND q^{p-1} ≡ 1 (mod p²)
4. **Thaine's theorem** - relates class group to units

### Why Mihailescu matters for Collatz

- Baker's theorem (transcendence) gives bounds but not proofs
- Mihailescu showed pure algebraic/cyclotomic methods can close gaps
- The Collatz cycle equation involves cyclotomic structure Φ_m(4,3)

### Stickelberger element (for reference)
```
θ = Σ_{a=1}^{p-1} (a/p) · σ_a^{-1}
```
where σ_a: ζ → ζ^a is Galois action.

## 3. "Bad Primes" for Tight Prime Approach

### Discovery

All primes that fail the tight condition (ord_p(2) < 2m) are **Mersenne divisors**.

| Prime p | ord_p(2) | Divides | Bad for m |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 5 | 4 | 2⁴-1 | 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 |
| 7 | 3 | 2³-1 | 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (all even) |
| 11 | 10 | 2¹⁰-1 | 10, 15, 20, 25 |
| 13 | 12 | 2¹²-1 | 12, 18, 24 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Why this happens

These are **inherited primes** from the factorization:
```
4^m - 3^m = ∏_{d|m} Φ_d(4,3)
```

Primes from Φ_d(4,3) for d < m have ord_p(4/3) = d < m, often giving ord_p(2) < 2m.

### The key fact

For m ≥ 5: **Primitive primes** (from Φ_m(4,3)) provide tight primes.
Inherited primes may fail tightness, but we only need ONE tight prime.

## 4. Quadratic Reciprocity and ord_p(2)

### The parity rule
```
ord_p(2) is even  ⟺  (2/p) = -1  ⟺  p ≡ 3 or 5 (mod 8)
ord_p(2) is odd   ⟺  (2/p) = +1  ⟺  p ≡ 1 or 7 (mod 8)
```

### Connection to tightness

If ord_p(2) is even: ord_p(4) = ord_p(2)/2
If ord_p(2) is odd: ord_p(4) = ord_p(2)

For tight: need ord_p(2) ≥ 2m
If p ≡ 3,5 (mod 8) and ord_p(4) ≥ m, then ord_p(2) = 2·ord_p(4) ≥ 2m ✓

## 5. Open Questions for Investigation

### Q1: Stickelberger for Collatz?
Can Stickelberger-type annihilation results be applied to ideals arising from 4^m - 3^m?

### Q2: "Collatz Wieferich" condition?
Is there a mod p² condition that forces tight primes, analogous to double Wieferich in Catalan?

### Q3: Primitive prime distribution
For large m, what fraction of primitive primes p | Φ_m(4,3) are tight?
Empirically ~85%, but why?

### Q4: Growth phase → cycle impossibility
Can the growth self-limitation theorem (LTE-based) be connected to the cycle analysis?
If trajectories can't sustain growth, and can't cycle, they must descend.

## 6. Techniques NOT to Pursue (Failed Approaches)

See COLLATZ_FAILED_APPROACHES_ANALYSIS.md for details:

1. **Ergodic/probabilistic** - "Almost all" ≠ "all"
2. **Transfer operators** - Mixing doesn't capture exceptional trajectories
3. **Automata theory** - Wrong structural lens
4. **p-adic naive** - 2-adic and 3-adic have conflicting completions

## 7. Key Computational Tools

### Multiplicative order
```python
def mult_ord(a, n):
    for d in divisors(n - 1):
        if pow(a, d, n) == 1:
            return d
```

### Cyclotomic polynomial value
```python
def Phi_m(x, y, m):
    # Φ_m(x,y) via Möbius: ∏_{d|m} (x^d - y^d)^{μ(m/d)}
```

### 2-adic valuation
```python
def v2(n):
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count
```
