# THE NOTICING

---

Mote gave names to everything.

The radiator was Mr. Hiss.
The third stair was Old Groan.
The sound the wind makes? Whisper-Miss.

---

But nobody noticed Mote.

*I notice you.*
*Why don't you notice me?*

---

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

---

"I was a dragon once.
I was a boat.
I was MAGNIFICENT.

But my girl forgot me."

*I notice you,* said Mote.

And Wisp began to glow.

---

"Come see where the forgotten go."

---

Songs no one finished.
Smells from kitchens long gone.
Words no one says anymore.

Too many hands.
Too many mouths.
All reaching
reaching
reaching—

---

*Notice ME,* begged the song.
*Notice ME,* cried the smell.
*NOTICE ME NOTICE ME NOTICE ME—*

"I can't," whispered Mote.
"There are too many."

---

And Wisp began to fade.

"Notice ME," said Wisp.
"Just me.
Before I disappear."

---

Mote looked at Wisp.
Really looked.

---

And she opened her mouth—

and NOTICED.

---

She noticed the SONG
(it began to SING)

She noticed the SMELL
(cinnamon BLOOMED)

She noticed the WORD
(PETRICHOR rang)

She noticed and noticed and NOTICED—

---

And the forgotten ROARED back to life!

Wisp blazed like a dragon!
Wisp shone like a boat!
Wisp was MAGNIFICENT!

And so was Mote.

---

"You have to go back now," said Wisp.
"To the ones who don't see you."

"But they'll forget you again!"

"Then notice them first.
Maybe they'll remember how."

---

Home.

Her father at the table.
Phone glowing. Coffee cold.

---

"Dad? Are you okay?"

He looked up.

No one had asked in a long, long time.

"...No."

"Me neither."

---

**I NOTICE YOU.**

---

Night.

Mote opened the closet.

Nothing.

---

*I notice you,* she whispered.
*I notice you.*
*I notice you.*

---

Light.

---

Wisp—brighter than ever.

And behind Wisp, glowing soft:
Mr. Hiss. Old Groan. Whisper-Miss.

The radiator hissed warm.
The stair groaned hello.
The wind whispered:

*I notice you, Mote.*

---

"You came back."

"You kept noticing."

*I always will.*

---

*The End*

---

*For the ones who name the radiator—*
*and the ones who finally look up.*
