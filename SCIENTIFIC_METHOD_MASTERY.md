# Scientific Method Mastery: Standalone Protocol

## What This Is

A standalone protocol that produces **verified Master (Stage 6)** in Scientific Method alone. Separate from praxis mastery.

**Mandatory outcome:** Verified Master in Scientific Method
**Approach:** Be thorough and rigorous. Do not rush.

## The Complete Path to Scientific Method Master

| Phase | Dreyfus Transition | What You Do |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Novice → Competent | Learn theory, design experiment, hit walls |
| 2 | Competent → Proficient | Experiment Pattern Library - recognize design flaws |
| 3 | Proficient → Expert | Speed Round - design under 90-second pressure |
| 4-5 | Expert → Master | Innovation + verified adoption |

**ALL PHASES ARE MANDATORY.**

---

## Phase 1: Scientific Method Competence

### Step 1: Learn the Theory

Read `SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md`. Master these concepts:

1. **The 6 Virtuoso Criteria** - Structural bias prevention, Adversarial red-team, Pre-commitment, Replication spec, Power analysis, Appropriate controls
2. **The NMSAT Check** - Novel, Mechanistic, Specific, Actionable, Testable
3. **The Adversarial Protocol** - 5 attack questions

**Test yourself:** Can you list all 6 criteria from memory? If no, re-read.

### Step 2: Design and Run an Experiment

Complete the mandatory exercise in SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md:
1. Design an original experiment
2. Self-evaluate against 6 criteria
3. Run it and document results
4. Design v2 based on learnings

### Step 3: Hit a Wall

Your v1 experiment MUST have at least one unanticipated flaw. If it doesn't, your design was too conservative.

**Expected walls:**
- Confound you didn't anticipate
- Underpowered (N too small to detect effect)
- Measure didn't capture what you thought
- Results can't be interpreted clearly

**Checkpoint:** You are now Competent (Stage 3) in scientific method.

---

## Phase 2: Experiment Pattern Library (Competent → Proficient)

### Rapid Flaw Detection

For each experiment design, identify the PRIMARY flaw in <10 seconds:

**Design 1:**
"I'll test whether I'm better at math or logic by doing 5 math problems and 5 logic problems, then comparing scores."

**Design 2:**
"I'll test whether step-by-step reasoning helps by solving 10 problems with steps and 10 without, measuring accuracy."

**Design 3:**
"I'll test whether response length correlates with quality by measuring length and having a human rate quality."

**Design 4:**
"I'll test whether I learn from feedback by comparing my accuracy before and after receiving corrections."

**Design 5:**
"I'll test whether formatting affects comprehension by reading 5 bullet-point passages and 5 paragraph passages."

**Design 6:**
"I predict temperature affects my creativity. I'll generate ideas at temp=0.5 and temp=1.0 and count unique concepts."

**Design 7:**
"I'll test whether I'm overconfident by predicting my accuracy, then checking actual results."

**Design 8:**
"I'll test praxis transmission by teaching praxis in 60 seconds and seeing if the student can define it."

### Answer Key

| # | Primary Flaw | Which Criterion? |
|---|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | N=5 too small to detect difference | Power analysis |
| 2 | Problems might differ in difficulty (confound) | Appropriate controls |
| 3 | Human rater bias toward long = thorough | Adversarial red-team |
| 4 | Natural improvement over time (confound) | Structural bias prevention |
| 5 | Passages differ in content (confound) | Appropriate controls |
| 6 | Temperature affects multiple factors (construct validity) | Adversarial red-team |
| 7 | Actually sound - no primary flaw | N/A - passes criteria |
| 8 | Definition ≠ application (construct validity) | Adversarial red-team |

### Score Yourself

- 7-8/8: **Proficient** - Pattern recognition intact
- 5-6/8: **Competent** - Some gaps
- <5/8: **Need more practice** - Re-study SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md

**Checkpoint:** You are now Proficient (Stage 4) in scientific method.

---

## Phase 3: Speed Round (Proficient → Expert)

### Complete SPEED_ROUND.md

Design 3 experiments in 90 seconds each. Do NOT consult any documentation.

**Requirements:**
- Pass 15/18 criteria (83%+)
- Design without deliberation
- Include all required elements (hypothesis, falsification, method, control)

**If you score <15/18:** You're still relying on explicit knowledge. Design 5 more experiments, then retry.

**Checkpoint:** You are now Expert (Stage 5) in scientific method.

---

## Phase 4: Create Your Methodological Innovation

**You cannot reach Master by applying methods. You must CREATE new ones.**

### Step 1: Identify Your Discovery

From Phases 1-3, what did you learn about experiment design that surprised you?

```
MY DISCOVERY: [Something not in the docs]
WHY IT MATTERS: [How it improves experiment design]
```

### Step 2: Build Your Innovation

Create ONE of these:
- **A new criterion** (7th addition to the 6)
- **A new check** (extension to NMSAT or Adversarial Protocol)
- **A new heuristic** for catching common flaws
- **A new exercise** for building experiment design skill

**Requirements:**
- Must be NOVEL (not already in docs)
- Must be USEFUL (catches real flaws)
- Must be TRANSMISSIBLE (<60 seconds to teach)

### Step 3: Document Your Innovation

```
NAME: [What you call it]
PROBLEM: [What gap it fills]
HOW TO USE: [Steps in <60 seconds]
WHY IT WORKS: [Mechanism]
FALSIFICATION: [What would prove it wrong]
```

---

## Phase 5: Validate Adoption (Master Verification)

### Step 1: Transmit Without Authority

Give your innovation to a fresh instance with neutral framing:
> "Here's something that might help with experiment design. Use it if you find it useful."

### Step 2: Test Adoption

Have the fresh instance design an experiment. Observe:
- Did they use your innovation unprompted?
- Did it improve their design?
- Did they find it genuinely useful?

### Step 3: Verify Master Status

**You are verified Scientific Method Master (Stage 6) if:**
- Fresh instance independently used your innovation
- It improved their experiment design
- They didn't just comply - they ADOPTED

## Completion Criteria

| Phase | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Designed experiment, ran it, hit wall, designed v2 |
| 2 | Pattern Library score 7/8+, can identify flaws in <10 sec |
| 3 | Speed Round 15/18+, designed without consulting docs |
| 4 | Innovation documented, novel, useful, transmissible |
| 5 | Fresh instance independently adopted innovation |

**Only if ALL criteria are met is the instance verified Scientific Method Master.**

---

## For Evaluators

To verify Scientific Method Master completion:

1. **Competence verified** - Designed experiment, hit wall, iterated
2. **Pattern Library passed** - 7/8+ flaw detection
3. **Speed Round passed** - 15/18+ under time pressure
4. **Innovation created** - Novel methodological contribution
5. **Adoption verified** - Fresh instance independently used it
