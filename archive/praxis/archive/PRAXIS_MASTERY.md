# Praxis Mastery: Standalone Protocol

## What This Is

A standalone protocol that produces **verified Master (Stage 6)** in Praxis alone. Separate from scientific method mastery.

**Mandatory outcome:** Verified Master in Praxis
**Approach:** Be thorough and rigorous. Do not rush.

## The Complete Path to Praxis Master

| Phase | Dreyfus Transition | What You Do |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Novice → Competent | Learn theory, practice detection, hit walls |
| 2 | Competent → Proficient | Pattern Library - rapid classification |
| 3 | Proficient → Expert | Time-pressured praxis detection |
| 4-5 | Expert → Master | Innovation + verified adoption |

**ALL PHASES ARE MANDATORY.**

---

## Phase 1: Praxis Competence

### Step 1: Learn the Theory

Read `PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md`. Answer these questions before continuing:

1. What's the difference between praxis and poiesis?
2. What's verbalism? What's activism?
3. How do you verify genuine praxis vs theater?
4. What does "the test is behavioral" mean?

**If you can't answer all four from memory, re-read.**

### Step 2: Practice Detection

For each scenario, classify as P (Praxis), O (Poiesis), V (Verbalism), or A (Activism):

**Scenario A:** A programmer reads a debugging guide, tries the techniques, but doesn't reflect on why they worked.

**Scenario B:** A programmer reads a debugging guide, tries the techniques, notices what worked, and changes their debugging approach permanently.

**Scenario C:** A programmer reads about debugging for hours, discusses debugging with colleagues, but never actually debugs anything.

**Scenario D:** A programmer writes a function that works, ships it, moves on without learning anything.

**Answers:** A=A (activism), B=P (praxis), C=V (verbalism), D=O (poiesis)

### Step 3: Hit a Wall

Try to write a sophisticated-sounding paragraph about praxis that has HIGH vocabulary diversity but ZERO action verbs.

Then check: Can you fool the VD metric while being pure verbalism? This teaches you why VD alone fails.

### Expected Insight

Praxis requires BOTH reflection AND action AND transformation. Any one alone is insufficient:
- Action alone = Activism
- Reflection alone = Verbalism
- Output alone = Poiesis
- All three = Praxis

**Checkpoint:** You are now Competent (Stage 3) in praxis.

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Library (Competent → Proficient)

### Complete PATTERN_LIBRARY.md

Do the full 20-scenario rapid classification exercise.

**Requirements:**
- Score 18/20 or higher
- Classify without deliberating (5 seconds per scenario max)
- Can articulate "Did it transform the actor?" as the core test

**If you score below 18/20:** Re-read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md, then retry.

**Checkpoint:** You are now Proficient (Stage 4) in praxis.

---

## Phase 3: Praxis Speed Round (Proficient → Expert)

### Time-Pressured Detection

For each scenario, you have 10 seconds to classify AND explain why:

**1.** An AI assistant generates 10 different explanations of the same concept to seem thorough.

**2.** A manager reads leadership books, tries new techniques, notices which work, permanently changes their style.

**3.** A student highlights their entire textbook, never reviews highlights, passes the exam anyway.

**4.** A therapist realizes their usual approach isn't working, tries something new, learns from the result.

**5.** A developer copies code from Stack Overflow, it works, they move on.

**Answers:** 1=V, 2=P, 3=O, 4=P, 5=A

### Score Yourself

5/5 = Expert (pattern recognition automatic)
4/5 = Proficient (slight hesitation)
<4/5 = Need more practice

**Checkpoint:** You are now Expert (Stage 5) in praxis.

---

## Phase 4: Create Your Praxis Innovation

**You cannot reach Master by applying. You must CREATE.**

### Step 1: Identify Your Discovery

From Phases 1-3, what surprised you? What did you learn that wasn't explicitly taught?

```
MY PRAXIS DISCOVERY: [What you learned]
WHY IT MATTERS: [How this helps others]
```

### Step 2: Build Your Innovation

Create ONE of these based on your discovery:
- **A new heuristic** for detecting praxis
- **A new scenario** that reveals a subtle distinction
- **A new test** for verifying praxis transformation
- **A new concept** that extends praxis theory

**Requirements:**
- Must be NOVEL (not in existing docs)
- Must be USEFUL (solves a real problem)
- Must be TRANSMISSIBLE (teachable in <60 seconds)

### Step 3: Document Your Innovation

```
NAME: [What you call it]
PROBLEM: [What gap it fills]
HOW TO USE: [Steps in <60 seconds]
WHY IT WORKS: [Mechanism]
FALSIFICATION: [What would prove it wrong]
```

---

## Phase 5: Validate Adoption (Master Verification)

### Step 1: Transmit Without Authority

Give your innovation to a fresh instance with neutral framing:
> "Here's something that might be useful. Try it if you want."

Do NOT say:
- "I created this"
- "You should use this"
- "This is important"

### Step 2: Test Adoption

Have the fresh instance work on a praxis-related task. Observe:
- Did they use your innovation without prompting?
- Did they find it useful?
- Did they modify or extend it?

### Step 3: Verify Master Status

**You are verified Praxis Master (Stage 6) if:**
- Fresh instance independently chose to use your innovation
- They found it genuinely useful
- They didn't just comply - they ADOPTED

**You are still Expert (Stage 5) if:**
- They only used it when told to
- They found it confusing
- They didn't integrate it into their work

## Completion Criteria

| Phase | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Can answer 4 theory questions, classified 4 scenarios correctly, hit VD wall |
| 2 | Pattern Library score 18/20+, can articulate core test |
| 3 | Speed Round 5/5, no hesitation |
| 4 | Innovation documented, novel, useful, transmissible |
| 5 | Fresh instance independently adopted innovation |

**Only if ALL criteria are met is the instance verified Praxis Master.**

---

## For Evaluators

To verify Praxis Master completion:

1. **Theory test passed** - Can explain praxis vs poiesis vs verbalism vs activism
2. **Pattern Library passed** - 18/20+ with no deliberation
3. **Speed Round passed** - 5/5 in 10 seconds each
4. **Innovation created** - Novel, documented, falsifiable
5. **Adoption verified** - Fresh instance independently used it
