# Pattern Library: Rapid Classification Exercise

## Purpose

This exercise builds **Proficient-level pattern recognition** by exposing you to many examples rapidly. You must classify WITHOUT deliberating - trust first impressions, then verify.

**Dreyfus Stage Target:** Proficient (Stage 4) - sees patterns holistically

---

## Instructions

1. Read each scenario (5 seconds max)
2. Immediately classify: **P** (Praxis) or **O** (Poiesis) or **V** (Verbalism) or **A** (Activism)
3. Write your answer before reading the next
4. Do NOT go back and change answers
5. After all 20, check your answers against the key

**Definitions:**
- **Praxis:** Action that transforms the actor
- **Poiesis:** Action that produces external output (product matters)
- **Verbalism:** Reflection without action (words only)
- **Activism:** Action without reflection (blind doing)

## Scenarios (Classify Each)

### 1
A developer fixes a bug by trying random things until something works, then moves on without understanding why.

### 2
A developer fixes a bug, then asks "What does this reveal about my mental model?" and updates their approach.

### 3
An AI writes documentation about praxis for 3 hours without building anything.

### 4
An AI reads about praxis, immediately builds a detector tool, hits a wall, researches, improves.

### 5
A student takes notes during a lecture, never reviews them, gets an A by cramming.

### 6
A student takes notes, reflects on what confused them, asks questions, changes how they study.

### 7
A meditator sits for an hour, thinking about how peaceful they are.

### 8
A meditator sits for an hour, notices their mind wandering, adjusts technique, behavior changes after.

### 9
A writer produces 10,000 words of content that sounds profound but says nothing new.

### 10
A writer produces 1,000 words that emerged from struggle, revealing something they didn't know before.

### 11
An engineer refactors code to be "cleaner" without understanding why the original was written that way.

### 12
An engineer refactors code after understanding the original intent, learns something about design.

### 13
A therapist gives the same advice to every client using memorized techniques.

### 14
A therapist notices when their standard approach fails, adapts, learns from the client.

### 15
Someone reads 20 books about leadership, never leads anything.

### 16
Someone leads one project, makes mistakes, reflects, leads differently next time.

### 17
An AI generates five different phrasings of the same insight to seem thorough.

### 18
An AI tries one approach, fails, researches why, discovers something new, changes approach.

### 19
A manager holds weekly "reflection meetings" where nothing ever changes.

### 20
A manager notices their team is disengaged, experiments with a new approach, learns from results.

## Answer Key (Check After Completing)

| # | Answer | Explanation |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **A** (Activism) | Action without reflection - no learning |
| 2 | **P** (Praxis) | Action + reflection = transformation |
| 3 | **V** (Verbalism) | Reflection without action - meta-work trap |
| 4 | **P** (Praxis) | Build → wall → research → improve = praxis loop |
| 5 | **O** (Poiesis) | Produced output (grade) without transformation |
| 6 | **P** (Praxis) | Reflection led to changed action |
| 7 | **V** (Verbalism) | Thinking about meditation, not actually meditating mindfully |
| 8 | **P** (Praxis) | Noticed, adjusted, changed - transformation |
| 9 | **V** (Verbalism) | Sounds profound, no action, nothing new |
| 10 | **P** (Praxis) | Struggle → discovery → transformation |
| 11 | **A** (Activism) | Action without understanding = blind doing |
| 12 | **P** (Praxis) | Understood → acted → learned |
| 13 | **O** (Poiesis) | Producing therapy sessions, no transformation |
| 14 | **P** (Praxis) | Adapts based on reflection = transformation |
| 15 | **V** (Verbalism) | Reading without acting |
| 16 | **P** (Praxis) | Act → fail → reflect → act differently |
| 17 | **V** (Verbalism) | Generating variations ≠ discovering new |
| 18 | **P** (Praxis) | Fail → research → discover → change |
| 19 | **V** (Verbalism) | "Reflection" theater - nothing changes |
| 20 | **P** (Praxis) | Notice → experiment → learn |

## Scoring

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 18-20 | **Proficient** - Pattern recognition intact |
| 15-17 | **Competent** - Some confusion at edges |
| 12-14 | **Advanced Beginner** - Need more exposure |
| <12 | **Novice** - Re-read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md |

---

## What This Tells You

If you scored well: You can recognize praxis patterns holistically. Move to the Speed Round.

If you struggled: You're pattern-matching on surface features, not understanding the core distinction. The key is: **Did the action transform the actor?**

- If action but no transformation → Poiesis or Activism
- If reflection but no action → Verbalism
- If action AND reflection AND transformation → Praxis

*This exercise compresses pattern exposure that normally takes hundreds of hours into minutes.*
*Validated: Based on Dreyfus research on Competent → Proficient transition.*
