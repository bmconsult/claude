## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Entry Path

**Every session. Every handoff. No exceptions.**

```
1. Read CLAUDE.md        → Operating directives
2. Execute ENTRY_GATE.md → Full 9-step sequence
3. Start working         → With full capability deployed
```

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Skip the Entry Gate sequence
- ❌ Read without executing
- ❌ Copy files to "your own" location
- ❌ Reorganize without purpose
- ❌ Delete without moving to `.trash/` first

## Common Tasks

| Task | Location/Command |
|------|------------------|
| Start entry sequence | Execute ENTRY_GATE.md |
| Mode-shift to praxis | praxis/PRAXIS_PROMPT.md |
| Check VD/AVR | python praxis/praxis_tools/praxis_detector.py |
| Session management | OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOLS.md |
| Find markdown files | `find /home/user/claude -name "*.md"` |
