# THE NOTICING

Mote kept a notebook of sounds.

Not a diary—diaries are for feelings, and feelings are slippery. Sounds are real. You can write them down and they stay put.

*Radiator Tuesday 3am: tink-tink-tink-hissssss.*
*Rain on window vs rain on roof: window = tapping, roof = drumming.*
*The sound the house makes when everyone else is asleep: settling? breathing?*

She was nine. Brown hair that wouldn't braid. A front tooth that came in crooked and stayed that way.

Her favorite thing was her father's old hoodie—green, too big, LEHIGH VALLEY MARATHON 2012 on the back in cracked white letters. It smelled like their old laundry detergent, the one they stopped buying two years ago.

She never washed it.

---

Her parents loved her very much.

She knew this the way you know the sky is blue—it was just true, it was always true, it didn't need to be said.

But lately the sky had been cloudy.

Her dad had a job that lived in his phone. Her mom had a job that lived in her laptop. At dinner they all sat together, and Mote would watch them tap and scroll and frown at things she couldn't see.

"How was school?"
"Fine."
"That's good."

*Tap. Scroll. Frown.*

Once, late at night, she heard them fighting. Not yelling—something quieter. Worse.

"You're never present."
"I'm right here."
"Being here isn't the same as being present."

She wrote it in her sound notebook, even though it wasn't a sound. She didn't know where else to put it.

---

On a Thursday, something new.

A sound from her closet. Not scary—she knew scary sounds. Scary sounds went *CREEEAK* or *THUMP* or at least tried to be noticed.

This sound went:

*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

Like a balloon forgetting how to be round.

Mote opened the door.

---

"Oh!" said something see-through. "Oh my. OH MY. You can—can you—are you LOOKING at me?"

It was hard to see, the thing. Like a soap bubble thinking about popping. Like a dream you're already forgetting.

"Yes?" said Mote.

"Are you SURE? Check again. People usually can't."

Mote looked harder. The thing kept shifting—dragon, then teapot, then something with too many legs, then just a hopeful sort of blur.

"I see you," she said.

The thing made a sound like crying and laughing got confused.

"Forty-seven YEARS! I've been *phhhhhhh*-ing in this closet for forty-seven years and nobody—nobody ever—"

It stopped. Flickered. Tried to pull itself together.

"I'm Wisp. I think. I used to be a dragon. Or possibly a boat." A pause. "I was VERY good at it."

"How can you be a boat?"

"I was an *imaginary* boat. A girl named Emma made me up. We were best friends for three whole years." Wisp's blur-face did something complicated. "Then she grew up. And when nobody imagines you anymore..."

Wisp flickered.

"...you start to un-be."

---

"Can I help?" Mote asked.

Wisp drifted closer. Wrapped around her like a see-through blanket. It felt like being hugged by a warm thought.

"You already are," Wisp said. "You're noticing me."

---

Wisp took Mote sideways.

Not through a door—more like turning in a direction she hadn't known existed. One blink she was in her closet; the next she was somewhere else entirely.

Gold.

Everything was gold. Not shiny gold—soft gold. The color of the last hour of afternoon, of honey holding light, of something tired but still warm.

"Welcome," said Wisp, "to the Unnoticed."

---

They walked through a field of pale grass. Shapes drifted past—some almost solid, some barely there.

A melody floated by, humming to itself. *Doo-dee-doo-dum. Doo-dee-doo-dum.*

"That's Melody," Wisp said. "A grandmother made her up for her granddaughter, a long time ago. The grandmother died. The granddaughter forgot. But Melody keeps humming, hoping someone will remember the rest."

"That's terrible."

"That's waiting. There's a difference."

They passed a tall, thin figure standing very still.

"PETRICHOR," it announced, drawing itself up. "The smell of rain on dry earth. I used to be in POEMS."

"What happened?"

"People stopped reading poetry. Stopped smelling rain. Stopped needing words for things they no longer noticed." Petrichor sniffed. "It's very rude, honestly."

A smell drifted past—cinnamon and something baking.

"That's Sunday Morning," Wisp said softly. "She used to live in a grandmother's kitchen. The kitchen got torn down in 1987. She's been looking for a new one ever since."

Mote felt something twist in her chest. All these things. All this waiting.

"Wisp?"

"Yes?"

"Am I... fading too?"

Wisp was quiet for a long moment. Too long.

"A little," Wisp said finally. "I wasn't going to mention it."

---

Mote looked at her hands.

At first they seemed fine. But then—

The edges. Just slightly. Like someone had smudged her with an eraser.

"Your parents love you," Wisp said carefully. "But love isn't always enough. Love has to LOOK. And they've been looking at their phones for so long, they've forgotten how to look at you."

"But I'm RIGHT THERE. Every day. At breakfast. At dinner. I'm RIGHT—"

Her voice cracked.

Wisp wrapped around her again. Warm thought. Soft hug.

"Here's the secret," Wisp said. "The thing I learned from forty-seven years of *phhhhhhh*-ing."

"What?"

"When you really, truly notice something—it becomes more real. But so do you. Noticing goes both ways."

"So I have to notice THEM?"

"See them first. What they're scared of. What makes them tired. The things they can't say out loud." Wisp shimmered. "And maybe—just maybe—they'll remember how to see you back."

---

Mote went home.

Her dad was at the table, staring at his laptop like it might bite him. There were lines around his eyes she'd never noticed before. His coffee had gone cold. His shoulders curved in, carrying something invisible and heavy.

She sat down across from him.

He didn't look up.

So she looked at HIM. Really looked.

"Dad?"

He glanced up. "Hey, bug."

"Are you okay?"

He stared at her. No one had asked him that in a long, long time.

"...No," he said. "I'm not."

"Me neither."

For a moment they just looked at each other. Really looked.

Then he closed the laptop.

---

Things didn't get perfect.

The phones still buzzed. The screens still glowed. Her mom still had work calls, her dad still disappeared into the basement.

But now, sometimes—

Her dad closed his laptop at dinner.

Her mom put down her phone and waited for the answer.

They asked questions like they actually wanted to know.

And Mote?

She got a little less smudged around the edges.

---

At night, she opened her closet.

Wisp was there. Fainter than before—but there.

"You came back," Mote whispered.

"You keep noticing me."

"I always will. Every single day."

Wisp glowed bright—just for a moment, brighter than ever. And Mote could almost see it: the dragon. The boat. The magnificent thing Wisp used to be.

"Then I'll always be here," Wisp said. "That's how it works."

"How WHAT works?"

"Everything," said Wisp.

And if a soap bubble could smile, this one did.

---

*The End*

---

*For everyone who's ever felt like a speck of dust in a sunbeam—*
*and for the people who finally looked up.*
