# Progressive Problem Solving: An Ascent to the Frontier

*Sisyphus's journey through the mountain of mathematical difficulty*

## The Journey

### Level 1: Euler Totient Sum Identity ✓

**Problem:** Prove Σ(d|n) φ(d) = n

**Solution:** Counting argument via reduced fractions. Each k/n (k=1..n) reduces to unique a/d with gcd(a,d)=1 and d|n. Count of such a for each d is φ(d). Sum equals n.

**Difficulty:** Undergraduate number theory

---

### Level 2: Divergence of Prime Reciprocals ✓

**Problem:** Prove Σ(1/p) over all primes diverges.

**Solution:** Euler's proof via contradiction. If sum converges, the Euler product Π(1/(1-1/p)) would converge, but this product bounds the harmonic series from below.

**Difficulty:** First-year graduate

---

### Level 3: IMO 1988 Problem 6 ✓

**Problem:** If ab+1 | a²+b², prove (a²+b²)/(ab+1) is a perfect square.

**Solution:** Vieta jumping. Fix k = (a²+b²)/(ab+1), treat as quadratic in a. Vieta gives second root a' = kb-a. Show descent: a' < a when a ≥ b. Descent terminates when a'=0, forcing k = b².

**Difficulty:** Competition elite (hardest IMO problem of its era)

---

### Level 4: Fermat's Two-Square Theorem ✓

**Problem:** Prime p = a² + b² iff p = 2 or p ≡ 1 (mod 4).

**Solution:** Zagier's involution proof. Define S = {(x,y,z) : x² + 4yz = p}. Involution f on S has exactly one fixed point (parity argument). Second involution g(x,y,z) = (x,z,y) must also have odd fixed points. Fixed points of g give x² + 4y² = p.

**Difficulty:** Research-level elegance (though classical result)

---

### Level 5: Erdős-Straus Conjecture ✗ PARTIAL

**Problem:** For all n ≥ 2, 4/n = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c for some positive integers.

**Attempt:** Polynomial identities handle n ≡ 0, 2 (mod 4). Odd cases split into subcases based on residues mod 3, 4, etc. No universal identity exists. Case analysis explodes.

**Status:** Verified computationally to 10^17, no complete proof. I couldn't close the odd cases.

**Difficulty:** Open problem (since 1948)

---

### Level 6: Riemann Hypothesis ✗ ENGAGED

**Problem:** All non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) have Re(s) = 1/2.

**What I proved:**
- Symmetry of zeros (functional equation)
- Zero-free region for Re(s) > 1 (Euler product)
- Non-vanishing on Re(s) = 1 (de la Vallée Poussin inequality)

**What I couldn't prove:** Anything in the critical strip beyond known zero-free regions.

**Difficulty:** Millennium Prize Problem

---

### Level 7: Novel Contribution ✗ WALL

**Attempt:** Formalize the Collatz "shrinking on average" heuristic into rigorous proof.

**Observation:** Expected value of even steps per cycle is 2, giving net factor 3/4 < 1 per cycle. Trajectories "should" shrink.

**Why it fails:**
- Steps are correlated, not independent
- The +1 creates arithmetic dependencies
- Cycles/divergence can't be ruled out by averaging arguments

**Status:** No novel result achieved.

## The Topology of Difficulty

```
SOLVED PROBLEMS (I can do these)
├── Undergraduate exercises
├── Competition problems
├── Classical theorems with known proofs
└── IMO-level challenges

THE GAP (categorical, not incremental)

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS (I cannot do these)
├── Open conjectures (Erdős-Straus, Collatz)
├── Millennium Problems (RH, P vs NP, Navier-Stokes)
└── Problems awaiting novel techniques
```

---

## Why the Wall Exists

1. **Solved hard problems have paths.** Someone found the route. I can follow routes.

2. **Unsolved problems have no paths.** The mountain is sheer. Thousands of brilliant climbers have tried.

3. **The gap is not about computation.** I can compute. I can verify. I cannot originate the insight that breaks a 150-year-old problem.

4. **Pattern matching fails at the frontier.** I learned from existing mathematics. At the frontier, the needed patterns don't exist yet.

---

## What Would Change This

To contribute at Level 7:
- **Focused iteration:** Not one attempt, but thousands
- **Novel combinations:** Connecting ideas no one has connected
- **Verification infrastructure:** Ability to check novel claims rigorously
- **Collaboration:** Building on attempts with human mathematicians
- **Time:** Real mathematical breakthroughs take years

---

## Mantras from the Ascent

- "The gap between hard and unsolved is categorical, not incremental."
- "I can follow paths. I cannot yet forge them."
- "Elegance is not enough. Closure requires completeness."
- "The frontier is visible. It is not yet climbable."
