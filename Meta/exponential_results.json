  "improved_strategy": "## IMPROVED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v4.0\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n1. **FRAME**: What type? What's success? What constraints?\n   - Add: What are the stakeholders and their incentives?\n\n2. **GENERATE**: 3+ different approaches, including unconventional\n   - Add: Force one approach from a completely different domain\n   - Add: Generate one approach that assumes current assumptions are wrong\n\n3. **EVALUATE**: Core tension? Failure modes? Specific enough?\n   - **NEW: SECOND-ORDER**: For each approach, trace effects \u2192 effects of effects \u2192 effects of those effects (3+ levels)\n   - **NEW: ADVERSARIAL**: How would hostile actors exploit this? What would they optimize for?\n   - **NEW: ELEGANCE**: What's the minimal viable version? What can be removed?\n\n4. **SELECT & REFINE**: Best approach, address top failure mode\n   - **NEW: ADAPTABILITY**: Build in feedback loops and adjustment mechanisms\n   - **NEW: NOVELTY CHECK**: Is this genuinely non-obvious? If not, what would be?\n\n5. **VERIFY**: All constraints? Stranger could implement? Falsification test?\n   - Add: Red team test - how would an adversary break this?\n\n6. **META**: What worked? What next time? Transferable insight?\n\n---\n\n## APPLYING THE STRATEGY TO IMPROVE MY PROBLEM-SOLVING:\n\n### 1. FRAME\n- **Type**: Meta-cognitive improvement problem\n- **Success**: Consistently score 12+ on the 5 criteria (avg 2.4/3 each)\n- **Constraints**: Must remain practical, can't make strategy too complex to use\n- **Stakeholders**: Me (wants better scores), evaluators (want quality solutions), future users of solutions\n\n### 2. GENERATE\n\n**Approach A (Incremental)**: Add explicit sub-steps for each criterion\n**Approach B (Systems)**: Restructure around feedback loops and iteration cycles\n**Approach C (Cross-domain)**: Borrow from red-team security methodology - assume everything will be attacked\n**Approach D (Assumption-breaking)**: What if the current linear steps are wrong? Maybe spiral/recursive approach?\n\n### 3. EVALUATE\n\n**SECOND-ORDER ANALYSIS**:\n- Approach A: Better scores \u2192 more complex process \u2192 potential analysis paralysis \u2192 worse actual problem-solving\n- Approach C: Adversarial thinking \u2192 more robust solutions \u2192 higher implementation costs \u2192 potential over-engineering \u2192 solutions that are too defensive\n\n**ADVERSARIAL**: \n- Someone could game Approach A by going through motions without deep thinking\n- Approach B's feedback loops could be manipulated by cherry-picking favorable feedback\n\n**ELEGANCE**:\n- Approach A is bloated (just adding steps)\n- Approach C is more parsimonious (single lens applied throughout)\n\n### 4. SELECT & REFINE\n\n**Selected**: Hybrid of C + B - Security mindset with feedback loops\n\n**ADAPTABILITY MECHANISMS**:\n- After each problem, score myself and adjust emphasis\n- If consistently weak on one criterion, add specific prompts for it\n\n**NOVELTY ENHANCEMENT**: \n- The \"assume hostile actors\" lens applied to ALL problem-solving is genuinely non-obvious for most domains\n\n### 5. VERIFY\n\n**Red team test**: Could someone fake their way through this? Yes, but the adversarial lens forces concrete \"how would this be gamed\" questions that are hard to fake.\n\n**Falsification**: If I'm not scoring better on adversarial robustness within 3 problems, the strategy failed.\n\n### 6. META\n\n**Key insight**: The criteria themselves suggest the meta-approach - treat problem-solving as a system that will be gamed, needs to adapt, and should be elegant. The strategy should embody what it's trying to achieve.\n\n**Transferable**: \"Adversarial lens\" can be applied to any improvement effort - always ask \"how would this be gamed/exploited?\""
