  "final_methodology": "**STRATEGIC PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL v5.3**\n\nSTEP 0: FRAME THE PROBLEM\nWhat type of problem is this?\n- Analytical: Clear answer exists, decomposable\n- Systems: Feedback loops, dynamics, delays\n- Adversarial: Other agents who will respond to your moves\n- Wicked: Multiple stakeholders, value conflicts, no clean answer\n- Hybrid: Multiple types (most real problems)\n\nState your classification. If Hybrid, note all types that apply.\n\nSTEP 1: ASSUMPTION AUDIT (mandatory)\n1. List EVERY embedded assumption\n2. For EACH assumption, ask \"What if this is wrong?\"\n3. Identify the top 3 assumptions that most change the answer\n4. Keep these visible throughout your analysis\n\nSTEP 2: LEVERAGE FINDER (apply if Systems or Wicked)\n1. Map ALL feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)\n2. Identify where small input creates large output\n3. Prioritize high-leverage interventions over symptom treatment\n\nSTEP 3: RESPONSE CHAIN (apply if Adversarial)\n1. For each option, trace what others would do in response\n2. Then what you'd do to their response\n3. Trace 3+ moves minimum\n4. Evaluate outcomes at the END of the chain, not after your first move\n\nSTEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (mandatory)\nFor your recommended solution, specify:\n1. WHO: Specific roles/people responsible for each major component\n2. WHEN: Timeline with key milestones (weeks/months, not \"soon\")\n3. WHAT: Success metrics and decision criteria for next steps\n4. **HOW MUCH: Required resources with JUSTIFICATION ANCHOR - for each significant cost estimate, cite specific comparable data (market rates, benchmarks, similar projects) with the exact source and calculation method. NO RANGES OVER 25% SPAN (if initial estimate is $500K, range cannot exceed $375K-$625K). For any estimate lacking direct comparables, state \"ESTIMATE PLACEHOLDER: [amount] - requires [specific research task] to validate before execution.\" For total resource requirements exceeding $100K or 3 months timeline, provide explicit resource allocation rationale comparing focused single-approach execution vs. hybrid approach execution.**\n5. HOW: For each major component, specify the exact mechanism of execution\n6. **SCRIPT: For interpersonal components (negotiations, meetings, conversations), provide exact words or specific phrases to use. For process components, name the specific tool/template/format and describe its key structural elements.**\n7. **RESISTANCE MAP: Identify the 3 most likely sources of implementation resistance (people, processes, or politics) and specify exact countermeasures with numerical thresholds that trigger escalation (e.g., \"if adoption rate falls below X% after Y weeks, execute strategy Z\").**\n\nSTEP 5: VERIFY (mandatory)\n1. Check solution against ALL stated constraints\n2. Does this actually answer the original question?\n3. What could make this answer wrong?\n4. **COMPOUND FAILURE TEST: What if your top 3 assumptions are ALL wrong simultaneously? Test this specific scenario and specify what backup strategy you would execute.**\n5. **INTERACTION STRESS TEST: For each pair of your top 3 assumptions, specify exactly how their simultaneous failure would amplify or compound each other's impact on your strategy, then adjust your plan to account for these specific interaction effects.**\n6. MONITOR: For each top assumption, specify one measurable indicator with an exact threshold that triggers a pivot decision\n7. CONTINGENCY: For timeline-dependent plans, specify fallback actions if milestones slip by more than 20%\n8. State confidence level explicitly\n\nMETA-RULE:\nIf problem is Hybrid (most are) \u2192 apply MULTIPLE tools\nIf stuck at any point \u2192 you're solving the wrong problem \u2192 return to Step 0",
