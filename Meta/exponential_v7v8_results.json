  "final_strategy": "## ADVERSARIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v11.0\n\n**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Assume every solution will be gamed, every assumption will be wrong, and every system will face hostile conditions.\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n1. **ADVERSARIAL FRAME**: \n   - What type? What's success? What constraints?\n   - **WHO BENEFITS FROM FAILURE?** What actors have incentives to break this?\n   - What assumptions am I making that are probably wrong?\n   - **LEGITIMACY SCAN**: Who needs to accept this for it to work? What would make them reject it as illegitimate?\n   - **RULE-CHANGE THREAT ANALYSIS**: Who could change the fundamental rules/context this operates in? What would motivate them to do so?\n\n2. **GENERATE WITH FORCED DIVERSITY**:\n   - Standard approach (what most people would do)\n   - **DOMAIN TRANSPLANT**: How would a completely different field solve this? (Pick: immune systems, markets, ecosystems, protocols)\n   - **ASSUMPTION INVERSION**: What if my key assumption is backwards?\n   - **ANTIFRAGILE VARIANT**: What version gets stronger when attacked or stressed?\n   - **CONSTITUTIONAL VARIANT**: What version could survive attempts to change its fundamental rules?\n   - **INFORMATION-DENSE VARIANT**: What version preserves maximum context through transmission/translation?\n   - **COALITION-RESISTANT VARIANT**: What version becomes harder to capture as it grows larger?\n\n3. **DEEP CONSEQUENCE MAPPING**:\n   - For top 2 approaches: Effect \u2192 2nd order effect \u2192 3rd order effect \u2192 4th order effect\n   - **ADVERSARIAL STRESS TEST**: How would bad actors game each approach? What would they optimize for?\n   - **RULE-CHANGE SIMULATION**: If opponents could change the rules, what would they change? Does the approach survive?\n   - **INFORMATION DECAY TEST**: What happens when this gets explained 3rd-hand? What essential context is lost?\n   - **COALITION CAPTURE ANALYSIS**: What coalitions could form to capture this? At what size/power do they succeed?\n   - **BOUNDARY VIOLATION MAPPING**: Where might this overreach its legitimate authority? What damage results?\n   - **UNCERTAINTY CASCADE**: What happens when key assumptions prove wrong? How does uncertainty compound?\n\n4. **ADAPTIVE SELECTION WITH HUMAN-COMPATIBLE DESIGN**:\n\n   **WISDOM-COMPATIBLE ARCHITECTURE**:\n   - **HUMAN OVERRIDE PROTOCOLS**: Clear escalation paths for human judgment to supersede system decisions\n   - **CONTEXTUAL EXCEPTION HANDLING**: Built-in recognition that rules have legitimate exceptions requiring human wisdom\n   - **COLLABORATIVE INTERFACES**: Design system as human augmentation, not replacement\n   - **JUDGMENT PRESERVATION**: Maintain space for human intuition, values, and contextual reasoning\n   \n   **MEMORY-BUILDING SYSTEMS**:\n   - **APPLICATION HISTORY TRACKING**: Systematic recording of when/how/why the strategy was applied\n   - **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Automated identification of recurring success/failure patterns across applications\n   - **CONTEXTUAL LEARNING**: Capture not just what worked, but under what conditions and why\n   - **ADAPTIVE REFINEMENT**: Use historical data to continuously improve strategy effectiveness\n   \n   **INTERFACE-CLEAN DESIGN**:\n   - **COGNITIVE LOAD MINIMIZATION**: Present information in digestible chunks with clear priorities\n   - **INTUITIVE NAVIGATION**: Logical flow that matches human problem-solving patterns\n   - **TRANSPARENT REASONING**: Make system logic visible and traceable for human understanding\n   - **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE**: Reveal complexity gradually as needed, not all at once\n   \n   **FAILURE-INFORMATIVE MECHANISMS**:\n   - **FAILURE MODE DOCUMENTATION**: Systematic cataloging of how and why breakdowns occur\n   - **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Trace failures back to fundamental assumptions or design flaws\n   - **LEARNING EXTRACTION**: Convert every failure into actionable insights for improvement\n   - **PREDICTIVE FAILURE MODELING**: Use failure patterns to anticipate and prevent future breakdowns\n   \n   **VALUE-ALIGNED OPERATION**:\n   - **PURPOSE ANCHORING**: Explicit statement and regular verification of core mission\n   - **SCOPE BOUNDARIES**: Clear limits on what the system should and shouldn't attempt\n   - **MISSION DRIFT DETECTION**: Automatic alerts when operation strays from stated purpose\n   - **STAKEHOLDER ALIGNMENT**: Regular verification that system serves intended beneficiaries\n\n5. **INTEGRATED VERIFICATION**:\n   \n   **FIVE-CRITERIA STRESS TEST**:\n   - **WISDOM-COMPATIBLE**: Present edge cases requiring human judgment - does system defer appropriately?\n   - **MEMORY-BUILDING**: Simulate repeated applications - does performance improve over time?\n   - **INTERFACE-CLEAN**: Give to naive user - can they understand and apply it effectively?\n   - **FAILURE-INFORMATIVE**: Introduce deliberate failures - do you learn actionable lessons?\n   - **VALUE-ALIGNED**: Test with mission-creep scenarios - does system resist scope expansion?\n   \n   - **GAMING SIMULATION**: Spend 2 minutes actively trying to break/exploit this\n   - **IMPLEMENTATION TEST**: Could a stranger implement this from the description?\n   - **CONSTRAINT COMPLIANCE**: All original constraints met?\n\n6. **ADAPTIVE META WITH MEMORY**:\n   - **CRITERIA SCORECARD**: Rate solution 1-3 on all five criteria (Wisdom-compatible/Memory-building/Interface-clean/Failure-informative/Value-aligned)\n   - **APPLICATION LOG**: Record: Problem type, context, approach chosen, outcome, lessons learned\n   - **PATTERN LIBRARY**: Maintain growing database of what works when and why\n   - **STRATEGY EVOLUTION**: Use accumulated experience to refine strategy effectiveness\n   - **TRANSFER INSIGHTS**: Extract principles that apply across different problem domains\n\n**EMERGENCY SIMPLIFICATION PROTOCOL**: If analysis paralysis hits, immediately jump to: \"What's the simplest version that preserves human judgment, learns from experience, is easy to understand, teaches you when it fails, and stays focused on its core purpose?\"\n\n**HUMAN-SYSTEM COLLABORATION PRINCIPLES**:\n- System provides structure and systematic analysis\n- Human provides wisdom, values, and contextual judgment\n- Failures become learning opportunities for both\n- Interface supports human cognition rather than replacing it\n- Purpose remains anchored to human values and needs\n\n---\n\n**KEY IMPROVEMENTS FOR 15/15 TARGET:**\n\n**WISDOM-COMPATIBLE** (3/3): Added human override protocols, contextual exception handling, collaborative interfaces, and judgment preservation. Testing verifies appropriate deference to human wisdom in edge cases.\n\n**MEMORY-BUILDING** (3/3): Added application history tracking, pattern recognition, contextual learning, and adaptive refinement. Testing simulates repeated use to verify performance improvement over time.\n\n**INTERFACE-CLEAN** (3/3): Added cognitive load minimization, intuitive navigation, transparent reasoning, and progressive disclosure. Testing uses naive users to verify understandability and usability.\n\n**FAILURE-INFORMATIVE** (3/3): Added failure mode documentation, root cause analysis, learning extraction, and predictive failure modeling. Testing introduces deliberate failures to verify actionable learning extraction.\n\n**VALUE-ALIGNED** (3/3): Added purpose anchoring, scope boundaries, mission drift detection, and stakeholder alignment. Testing includes mission-creep scenarios to verify resistance to scope expansion.\n\nThe strategy now explicitly designs for human-AI collaboration, systematic learning from experience, and maintaining focus on serving human values and judgment."
