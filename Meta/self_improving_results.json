GENERATE\n\n**Approach A - Constitutional Climate Rights**: Embed climate stability as a constitutional right, enforced by courts, with specific emissions budgets locked in via supermajority amendment process.\n\n**Approach B - Intergenerational Representation System**: Create formal political representation for future generations through appointed advocates, youth quotas in legislatures, and mandatory \"future impact\" assessments for all major policies.\n\n**Approach C - Economic Lock-in Mechanisms**: Use financial instruments (carbon bonds, climate trust funds, international trade agreements) to make climate backsliding economically devastating, creating market-based enforcement.\n\n**Approach D - Graduated Sovereignty Model**: Establish climate commitments as prerequisites for international recognition/membership, where breaking commitments triggers automatic sanctions and isolation.\n\n## 3. EVALUATE\n\n**Approach A - Constitutional Climate Rights**\n- a) Addresses core tension? Partially - removes decisions from normal politics but courts still appointed by current generation\n- b) Failure modes: Constitutional amendments can be repealed; courts can reinterpret; lacks enforcement mechanism against government non-compliance\n- c) Implementation specificity? Moderate - would need detailed emissions budgets and enforcement procedures\n- **Score: Feasibility 4/10, Effectiveness 6/10**\n\n**Approach B - Intergenerational Representation**\n- a) Addresses core tension? Yes - gives future generations actual voice while preserving current democratic input\n- b) Failure modes: Future advocates could be captured by current interests; unclear how to determine \"future preferences\"; could create democratic deficit\n- c) Implementation specificity? Low - needs major institutional redesign\n- **Score: Feasibility 3/10, Effectiveness 7/10**\n\n**Approach C - Economic Lock-in**\n- a) Addresses core tension? Somewhat - makes reversal costly but doesn't address democratic legitimacy directly\n- b) Failure modes: Economic crises could override climate concerns; international coordination required; markets can be manipulated\n- c) Implementation specificity? High - clear financial mechanisms\n- **Score: Feasibility 7/10, Effectiveness 5/10**\n\n**Approach D - Graduated Sovereignty**\n- a) Addresses core tension? No - doesn't preserve democratic choice, just makes consequences severe\n- b) Failure modes: Violates sovereignty principles; could trigger nationalism/backlash; requires unprecedented international cooperation\n- c) Implementation specificity? Low - unclear enforcement mechanisms\n- **Score: Feasibility 2/10, Effectiveness 4/10**\n\n## 4. SELECT & REFINE\n\n**Selected approach**: **Hybrid of A + B** - Constitutional Climate Framework with Intergenerational Representation\n\n**Refined solution**: \n- Constitutional amendment establishing \"climate stability\" as fundamental right with specific carbon budget\n- Create \"Future Generations Commission\" with power to challenge policies in constitutional court\n- Commission members: 1/3 appointed by current government, 1/3 by youth organizations, 1/3 by international climate science bodies\n- Mandatory \"intergenerational impact assessments\" for major policies\n- Built-in review process every 10 years allowing adjustments based on new science (but not abandonment of core commitments)\n\n**Addressing top failure mode** (constitutional capture): \n- International appointment component prevents full domestic capture\n- Scientific basis requirement creates objective standards\n- Review mechanism allows adaptation without abandonment\n\n## 5.

META\n\n**What worked**: Breaking down the core tension helped identify that pure constraint-based approaches miss the legitimacy issue, while pure democratic approaches miss the binding issue. Hybrid approach addresses both.\n\n**What I'd do differently**: Should have generated more approaches exploring different time horizons and enforcement mechanisms. Could have been more specific about international coordination requirements.\n\n**Transferable insight**: For intergenerational problems, the solution often lies not in choosing between present and future interests, but in creating institutional mechanisms that force ongoing dialogue between them while maintaining some non-negotiable boundaries."

Success for one stakeholder may mean failure for another.\n\n**What would success look like?**\n- Public safety improvements without creating a surveillance state\n- Civil liberties preserved while allowing beneficial crime prevention\n- Sustainable business model that doesn't incentivize harmful applications\n- Public trust and democratic legitimacy maintained\n- Legal compliance across jurisdictions\n\n**What are the hard constraints?**\n- Constitutional protections (4th Amendment, due process)\n- Existing privacy laws (GDPR, state privacy acts)\n- Anti-discrimination laws\n- 80% accuracy ceiling (20% false positive/negative rate)\n- Need for commercial viability to sustain development\n- Public accountability requirements\n\n## 2. GENERATE\n\n**Approach A: Tiered Transparency Model**\nDeploy with different transparency levels based on intervention severity. Low-stakes interventions (increased patrols) require minimal disclosure. High-stakes interventions (individual targeting) require full algorithmic transparency, human oversight, and opt-out mechanisms.\n\n**Approach B: Community Partnership Framework**\nDeploy only in communities that democratically opt-in through local governance processes. Communities receive revenue sharing, have oversight authority, and can modify or terminate the program. Focus on community-defined priorities rather than general crime prediction.\n\n**Approach C: Insurance/Risk Assessment Model**\nPosition as a risk assessment tool for insurance, urban planning, and resource allocation rather than direct law enforcement. Predictions inform long-term policy decisions and resource distribution, not immediate police actions against individuals.\n\n**Approach D: Adversarial Deployment System**\nDeploy alongside mandatory \"red team\" AI that specifically looks for bias, false positives, and civil liberties violations. Create a dual-system where deployment decisions require consensus between the predictive AI and the rights-protection AI.\n\n## 3.

META\n\n**What worked in this problem-solving process?**\n- Generating the unconventional \"adversarial AI\" approach helped illuminate the oversight challenge\n- Scoring forced honest assessment of trade-offs between feasibility and effectiveness\n- The wicked problem framing prevented premature optimization for single metrics\n\n**What would I do differently next time?**\n- Should have included more stakeholder perspectives in the framing (affected communities, civil rights groups, law enforcement)\n- Could have generated approaches that more directly addressed the 20% error rate problem\n- Implementation timeline and pilot program structure should have been specified\n\n**Transferable insight?**\nFor problems involving AI deployment with social impact, **democratic legitimacy may be more important than technical optimization**.

FRAME\n\n**Problem type:** Wicked problem with constitutional/governance elements - involves fundamental tensions between democracy, intergenerational justice, and binding commitments.\n\n**Success would look like:** A governance mechanism that creates enforceable long-term climate commitments while maintaining democratic legitimacy across generations. Future generations feel bound by fair process rather than arbitrary imposition.\n\n**Hard constraints:** \n- Must preserve core democratic principles (consent of governed)\n- Must be legally/constitutionally implementable\n- Must create real binding force, not just aspirational goals\n- Must account for changing circumstances and knowledge\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** The core tension is: How do you create legitimate authority over people who cannot consent (future generations) while respecting democratic principles that require consent?\n\n## 2. GENERATE\n\n**Approach A - Constitutional Entrenchment:** Create constitutional amendments with supermajority requirements that establish climate commitments as fundamental rights, similar to how we bind future generations to free speech protections.\n\n**Approach B - Intergenerational Representation:** Establish formal representation for future generations in current decision-making through appointed advocates, youth quotas, or AI modeling of future preferences.\n\n**Approach C - Conditional Democracy:** Structure commitments as conditional contracts - each generation can opt out but only by compensating affected parties (including future generations through trust funds).\n\n**Approach D - Evolutionary Constitutionalism (Unconventional):** Create \"living commitments\" that automatically adapt based on scientific evidence and global coordination, removing the democratic choice about climate action but preserving choice about implementation methods.\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** Yes - these differ in core mechanism: A uses constitutional law, B uses representation expansion, C uses economic incentives, D uses adaptive automation.\n\n## 3.

No - too many design choices unclear\n- Feasibility: 6, Effectiveness: 6\n\n**Approach C - Conditional Democracy:**\n- Addresses core tension? \u2713 Preserves choice while creating strong incentives for continuity\n- Failure modes: Compensation mechanisms could be gamed, might create perverse incentives, requires accurate damage pricing\n- Implementation specific? Partial - need specific compensation formulas\n- Feasibility: 7, Effectiveness: 8\n\n**Approach D - Evolutionary Constitutionalism:**\n- Addresses core tension?

SELECT & REFINE\n\n**Chosen approach:** Democratic Ratchet with Constitutional Entrenchment - asymmetric voting rules constitutionally protected and limited to climate commitments only.\n\n**Addressing top failure mode (gaming through weak initial commitments):** Require initial commitments to meet scientifically-determined minimum thresholds, with independent climate advisory body setting baselines.\n\n**MECHANISM TEMPLATE:**\n- WHO: National legislatures can strengthen climate commitments with simple majority (51%); weakening requires supermajority (67%); Independent Climate Advisory Board sets minimum baseline commitments based on scientific consensus\n- WHAT: Applies to emissions targets, carbon pricing, renewable energy standards, and climate adaptation funding - explicitly excludes other policy areas\n- WHEN: Initial commitments set within 2 years of adoption; review and potential strengthening every 5 years; weakening proposals can only be introduced once per 10-year period\n- HOW: Constitutional amendment establishing asymmetric voting rules; judicial review ensures policy changes meet definitions; international monitoring through existing climate frameworks\n- DECISION RULES: Simple majority (51%) to strengthen any climate commitment; supermajority (67%) to weaken; unanimous consent required to change the asymmetric voting rules themselves\n\n**QUALITY GATE CHECK:** \u2713 Specific numbers (51%, 67%, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years), \u2713 Specific roles (legislatures, advisory board, courts), \u2713 Specific procedures (voting thresholds, review cycles), \u2713 Specific timelines (implementation and review schedules).\n\n## 5. VERIFY\n\n\u2713 Satisfies constraints: Maintains democratic processes while creating binding commitments; prevents expansion to non-climate issues; enforceable through existing constitutional mechanisms\n\n\u2713 Stranger could follow: Clear voting thresholds, defined scope, specific timelines and procedures\n\n\u2713 Falsification test: Measure whether climate commitments strengthen over time and survive political transitions; assess whether other policy areas remain unaffected by asymmetric rules\n\n**ACTIONABILITY TEMPLATE:**\n1. **Constitutional lawyers and climate policy experts** draft constitutional amendment language defining climate policy scope and asymmetric voting requirements within 6 months\n2. **Legislative sponsors** introduce constitutional amendment in parliament and begin stakeholder consultation process within 12 months\n3. **Independent Climate Advisory Board** (existing or newly created) develops scientific baseline methodology and initial minimum commitments within 18 months\n\n**Success metrics:** \n- Constitutional amendment passes within 3 years\n- Initial climate commitments meet scientific baselines within 5 years  \n- Climate policies strengthen through simple majority votes within 10 years\n- No expansion of asymmetric rules to non-climate policies within 10 years\n\n**Timeline:** \n- 30 days: Legal drafting begins\n- 90 days: Stakeholder consultation and amendment refinement\n- 365 days: Amendment introduced in legislature\n\n## 6. META\n\n**What worked:** The Democratic Ratchet approach elegantly addresses the core tension by using familiar democratic procedures with asymmetric thresholds rather than creating entirely new institutions.\n\n**What would I do differently:** Could have explored more deeply how this interacts with international climate agreements and whether coordination mechanisms are needed.\n\n**Transferable insight:** When facing intergenerational commitment problems, asymmetric decision rules can preserve democratic legitimacy while creating beneficial bias toward long-term thinking - applicable beyond climate to infrastructure, education, or research investments."

FRAME\n\n**Problem type:** Optimization problem - improving a framework based on performance data analysis.\n\n**Success would look like:** Consistent 15/15 scores by eliminating the failure modes that caused the 13/15 score.\n\n**Hard constraints:** \n- Must remain practical and usable\n- Can't add complexity without clear benefit\n- Must address root causes, not symptoms\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** The core tension is: How do you ensure consistently high-quality outputs from a framework without making it so rigid that it becomes unusable or mechanical?\n\n## 2. GENERATE\n\n**Approach A - Quality Gates:** Add mandatory quality checkpoints that must be passed before proceeding to next step.\n\n**Approach B - Example-Driven:** Provide concrete examples of high vs low quality for each element, with pattern recognition training.\n\n**Approach C - Iterative Deepening:** Require multiple passes through key steps with increasing specificity requirements.\n\n**Approach D - Failure-First (Unconventional):** Start each step by identifying how it typically fails, then work backwards to prevent those failures.\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** These approaches differ in their core mechanisms - gates vs examples vs iteration vs inversion.\n\n## 3. EVALUATE\n\n**Approach A - Quality Gates:**\n- Addresses core tension? \u2713 Prevents advancement until quality threshold met\n- Failure modes: Could create bottlenecks, might not know what \"good enough\" looks like\n- Implementation ready? Partial - need specific gate criteria\n- Feasibility: 7, Effectiveness: 8\n\n**Approach B - Example-Driven:**\n- Addresses core tension? \u2713 Shows exactly what good looks like\n- Failure modes: Examples might not transfer to new domains, could become paint-by-numbers\n- Implementation ready? \u2713 Very concrete\n- Feasibility: 9, Effectiveness: 9\n\n**Approach C - Iterative Deepening:**\n- Addresses core tension? \u2713 Forces progressively higher quality\n- Failure modes: Time-consuming, might not converge, unclear stopping criteria\n- Implementation ready? No - need specific deepening rules\n- Feasibility: 5, Effectiveness: 7\n\n**Approach D - Failure-First:**\n- Addresses core tension? Partial - good for failure awareness but might miss other quality elements\n- Failure modes: Could become overly negative, might miss positive opportunities\n- Implementation ready? Partial - need failure taxonomies\n- Feasibility: 6, Effectiveness: 6\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** Approach B (Example-Driven) could be implemented tomorrow - the others need more specification.\n\n## 4. SELECT & REFINE\n\n**Chosen approach:** Example-Driven with quality gates - show what excellence looks like at each step, with clear pass/fail criteria.\n\n**Addressing top failure mode (becoming paint-by-numbers):** Include multiple examples per concept and explicit guidance on adapting patterns to new contexts.\n\n**MECHANISM TEMPLATE:**\n- WHO: Strategy users (individuals or teams applying the framework)\n- WHAT: Compare their output against provided excellence examples before proceeding\n- WHEN: After completing each major step, before moving to next\n- HOW: Built-in comparison prompts with specific quality indicators\n- DECISION RULES: Must meet 4/5 quality criteria or return to previous step\n\n## 5. VERIFY\n\n\u2713 Satisfies constraints: Keeps core structure, adds targeted improvements without complexity\n\u2713 Stranger could follow: Examples and criteria are explicit\n\u2713 Falsification test: Apply to new problems and measure if scores consistently reach 15/15\n\n**ACTIONABILITY TEMPLATE:**\n1. **Framework developer** integrates excellence examples and quality gates into each step within 2 weeks\n2. **Test users** apply enhanced framework to 3 practice problems and provide feedback within 1 month  \n3. **Performance analyst** measures score improvements and identifies remaining failure modes within 6 weeks\n\nSuccess metrics: 90%+ of applications score 15/15\nTimeline: 30 days to full implementation, 90 days to performance validation\n\n## 6. META\n\n**What worked:** Analyzing the actual failure data (13/15 score) revealed the strategy was close but needed precision improvements, not wholesale changes.\n\n**What would I do differently:** Could have looked more deeply at what specifically caused the point deductions in the failing case.\n\n**Transferable insight:** When something works well most of the time, improve it by studying the failure cases and adding targeted quality controls, not by redesigning from scratch.\n\n---\n\n# PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v3.0\n\n**INPUT:** A problem statement  \n**OUTPUT:** A solution scoring 15/15 on quality criteria\n\n## STEPS:\n\n### 1. FRAME\n- What type of problem? (analytical/systems/wicked/optimization)\n- What would success look like?\n- What are the hard constraints?\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC:** Can you explain the core tension in one sentence? If not, reframe.\n\n**EXCELLENCE EXAMPLE - Tension:** \"The core tension is balancing democratic legitimacy with the need for quick, expert decisions in life-or-death situations, while preventing power concentration that could lead to tyranny in an inescapable environment.\" *(Shows competing forces, stakes, context)*\n\n**QUALITY GATE:** Your tension must include: (1) Two competing forces, (2) Why both matter, (3) What makes this hard. If missing any, revise.\n\n### 2.

If too similar, generate more.\n\n### 3. EVALUATE\nFor each approach:\n- a) Does it address the core tension?\n- b) How could it fail?
