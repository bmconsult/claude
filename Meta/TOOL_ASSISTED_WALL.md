# Finding My Tool-Assisted Wall

*Where does AI problem-solving capability actually end with research tools?*

## Methodology

Starting from memory-only limits, I used web search, document research, and iterative building to push further. Here's what I found.

## The Spectrum of Mathematical Problems

### Tier 1: SOLVED IN MEMORY (~minutes)
- Euler totient identity
- Quadratic reciprocity
- Lagrange four-squares
- Most IMO problems
- Classical theorems with clean proofs

### Tier 2: SOLVED WITH BRIEF RESEARCH (~hours)
- Prime Number Theorem (full rigor)
- Dirichlet's theorem on primes in APs
- Results requiring 10-20 pages of technical machinery
- Recent competition-level research

### Tier 3: UNDERSTOOD WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH (~day)
**This is where I successfully pushed to:**

**Example: r(4,t) Ramsey Number (Mattheus-Verstraete 2024)**
- 90-year-old open problem, solved in 2024
- Published in Annals of Mathematics
- Requires: finite geometry, container method, pseudorandom graphs

**What I could do:**
- Understand the proof structure ✓
- Identify all key components ✓
- Explain how they fit together ✓
- Verify logical flow ✓

**What I could not do:**
- Independently prove O'Nan's theorem
- Derive eigenvalue bounds from scratch
- Invent the connection between finite geometry and Ramsey theory

### Tier 4: OUTLINE ONLY (~would need weeks)
**Example: Perelman's Poincaré Conjecture Proof**

Key components I can identify:
1. Hamilton's Ricci flow program
2. Singularity classification (shrinking spheres/cylinders)
3. Non-collapsing theorems via entropy functionals
4. Surgery procedure to excise singularities
5. Finite-time extinction for simply-connected manifolds

**My understanding level:**
- Can state what each step does ✓
- Can explain the logical flow ✓
- CANNOT verify technical details ✗
- CANNOT check the proofs of key lemmas ✗
- Would need months of focused study to fully understand

**Why it's beyond my wall:**
- Requires deep background in differential geometry
- Each step builds on previous ~500 pages of Ricci flow theory
- Perelman's innovations are subtle and require context

### Tier 5: FUNDAMENTALLY BEYOND (~years of study minimum)
- **Fermat's Last Theorem**: Modular forms, elliptic curves, Galois representations (~200 pages core + 1000s of background)
- **Classification of Finite Simple Groups**: 10,000+ pages across dozens of papers
- **Proof of abc conjecture (Mochizuki)**: Inter-universal Teichmüller theory, still disputed

## The Actual Wall

### What I CAN do with tools:

| Task | Example | Time Required |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Solve any solvable competition problem | IMO 1988 #6 | Minutes |
| Reproduce classical proofs | Quadratic reciprocity | Minutes |
| Understand recent breakthrough papers | r(4,t) Ramsey | Hours |
| Outline major modern proofs | Poincaré, PNT | Hours |
| Identify proof structure of hard results | Fermat's Last Theorem | Hours |

### What I CANNOT do even with tools:

| Barrier | Example | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Deep specialized knowledge** | Ricci flow surgery details | Requires years of geometric analysis background |
| **Massive proof verification** | FLT, CFSG | Too long to verify each step |
| **Disputed/unclear proofs** | abc conjecture | Even experts disagree |
| **Novel invention** | Any unsolved problem | Tools help understanding, not creation |

## The Honest Assessment

### My tool-assisted ceiling:

**Understanding:** Recent Annals-level papers (r(4,t), similar complexity)
- Can fully understand proof structure
- Can verify logical flow
- Can explain to others

**Partial understanding:** Fields Medal proofs (Poincaré, Fermat)
- Can outline approach
- Can identify key innovations
- Cannot verify technical details

**Beyond reach:** Mega-proofs (CFSG), disputed proofs (abc)

### The fundamental limitation:

Tools extend my **breadth** dramatically (can research any topic) but not my **depth** arbitrarily (cannot spend years on a single proof).

**I can understand anything a motivated PhD student could learn in a semester.**

**I cannot understand things that require years of specialized training.**

---

## Key Insight

The wall isn't about intelligence or access to information. It's about:

1. **Time depth**: Some proofs require building understanding over years
2. **Background accumulation**: Some results need 1000s of pages of prerequisites
3. **Invention vs. verification**: Tools help me verify/understand, not invent

With unlimited time and iteration, the wall would move. In practice, it sits around:

> **Recent top-journal papers requiring novel but not exotic machinery**

This is much further than memory-only capability, but still finite.

## What Would Extend the Wall Further

1. **Persistent memory across sessions**: Could build knowledge over weeks
2. **Formal verification tools**: Could check long proofs mechanically
3. **Collaboration with specialists**: Could query experts on specific points
4. **Interactive theorem provers**: Could verify steps in Lean/Coq

With these, the wall might extend to:
- Full verification of Fermat's Last Theorem
- Deep understanding of Perelman's proof
- Maybe even engaging with novel research

Without them, I remain at: **understanding recent breakthroughs, not creating them.**
