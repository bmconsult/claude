      "problem": "A software company's best engineer wants to leave for a competitor. They have critical knowledge not documented anywhere. The CEO has 24 hours before the engineer's final decision. What should the CEO do?",
      "solution": "# STRATEGIC PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL v5.2-V\n\n## STEP 1: ASSUMPTION AUDIT\n\n**Hidden Assumptions:**\n\n1. **The engineer is leaving primarily for money/role advancement**\n   - If wrong: They might be leaving due to culture, burnout, ethical concerns, or personal reasons that can't be addressed with traditional retention tactics.\n\n2. **Critical knowledge can be effectively transferred in a short timeframe**\n   - If wrong: Even if the engineer stays temporarily, the knowledge transfer might be incomplete or ineffective, creating false security.\n\n3. **The competitor offer is the only external factor driving the decision**\n   - If wrong: There might be industry-wide shifts, personal life changes, or multiple opportunities making retention impossible regardless of counteroffer.\n\n4. **The engineer's departure would be immediately catastrophic**\n   - If wrong: The urgency might lead to poor decisions; the company might be more resilient than assumed.\n\n5. **The engineer is acting in good faith and open to negotiation**\n   - If wrong: They might have already mentally checked out, be using this as leverage for something else, or have non-negotiable reasons for leaving.\n\n## STEP 2: STRATEGIC DEPTH\n\n**2nd Order Consequences:**\n- Setting precedent for retention negotiations could lead to other employees manufacturing departure threats\n- Rapid promotion or compensation increases might create internal equity issues\n- Emergency knowledge transfer might reveal other single-points-of-failure\n\n**3rd Order Consequences:**\n- Company culture could shift toward transactional relationships rather than loyalty-based retention\n- The retained engineer might become a flight risk again within 12-18 months with better preparation\n\n**Non-obvious Downstream Effect:**\nThe crisis could catalyze implementing robust knowledge management systems and succession planning, ultimately making the company more resilient than before the threat.\n\n## STEP 3: FRAME ALTERNATIVES\n\n**Frame 1: Retention Crisis**\n- Focus on keeping the engineer at all costs\n- Immediate counteroffer and emergency negotiations\n\n**Frame 2: Knowledge Continuity Crisis** \n- Focus on preserving and transferring critical knowledge\n- Accept potential departure but minimize damage\n\n**Frame 3: Organizational Resilience Opportunity**\n- Focus on systemic improvements triggered by this wake-up call\n- Use crisis to build anti-fragile systems\n\n**Chosen Frame: Knowledge Continuity Crisis**\nThis is most generative because it addresses the core business risk while remaining flexible about the engineer's decision. It forces focus on concrete, transferable solutions rather than potentially futile retention efforts.\n\n## STEP 4: ACTIONABLE SOLUTION\n\n**Immediate Strategy: Parallel Path Approach**\n\n**Clear First Step:**\nCEO personally calls the engineer within 2 hours to request a 1-hour meeting today. Script: \"I want to understand your decision and see if there's a path forward that works for both of us. Regardless of your choice, I need your help ensuring project continuity.\"\n\n**Primary Actions (next 24 hours):**\n1. **Discovery conversation** - Understand real motivations (not just stated ones)\n2. **Knowledge audit** - Map critical knowledge with engineer's help\n3. **Dual proposal** - Present retention package AND transition plan simultaneously\n4. **Documentation sprint** - Begin immediate knowledge capture session\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Primary: Critical knowledge mapped and initial transfer begun within 48 hours\n- Secondary: Engineer agrees to extended transition period (2-4 weeks minimum)\n- Tertiary: Engineer reconsiders departure\n\n**Contingency:**\nIf engineer refuses extended transition, immediately implement emergency shadowing protocol with 2nd-best technical team members for any remaining time.\n\n## STEP 5: SOLUTION VERIFICATION\n\n### CHECK A - ASSUMPTION STRESS TEST\n\n**Assumption 1: Critical knowledge can be transferred effectively (60% probability this is wrong)**\n- If wrong: Solution adapts by focusing on identifying external consultants or rehiring engineer as contractor for specific projects\n- Backup: Create detailed technical debt documentation to guide future reconstruction efforts\n\n**Assumption 2: Engineer is open to negotiation (30% probability this is wrong)**\n- If wrong: Solution still works because it prioritizes knowledge capture over retention\n- Adaptation: Shift immediately to documentation and reverse-engineering of engineer's work\n\n### CHECK B - ADVERSARIAL SIMULATION\n\n**If I were undermining this solution, I would:**\n- Advise the engineer to refuse knowledge sharing to maintain leverage\n- Point out legal risks of sharing proprietary information with departing employee\n- Encourage immediate departure to avoid awkward transition period\n\n**Weakest Link:** The assumption that 24-48 hours is sufficient for meaningful knowledge transfer.\n\n**Safeguard:** Prepare legal framework for consulting arrangement that extends knowledge access beyond employment termination, with appropriate IP protections.\n\n### CHECK C - CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION\n\n**Confidence Level: 75%**\n\n**Evidence that would revise confidence UP:**\n- Engineer expresses willingness to help with transition regardless of final decision\n- Critical knowledge is more systematized than initially assumed\n- Strong internal technical team capable of rapid knowledge absorption\n\n**Evidence that would revise confidence DOWN:**\n- Engineer reveals decision is final and non-negotiable\n- Critical knowledge is more complex/tacit than documented\n- Legal restrictions on post-employment collaboration\n\n**Most Important Unknown:** The true nature and transferability of the critical knowledge - is it systematic expertise that can be documented, or intuitive/experiential knowledge that requires extended mentoring?\n\n---\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:** Execute the parallel path approach immediately, prioritizing knowledge continuity while remaining open to retention. The 24-hour deadline should focus on securing cooperation for transition planning rather than forcing an immediate retention decision.",

      "problem": "A hospital has 30% more patients than beds. The board wants to build a new wing (2 years, $50M) but the CFO says they'll be bankrupt in 6 months at current burn rate. What should they do?",
      "solution": "# STRATEGIC PROBLEM-SOLVING: HOSPITAL CAPACITY CRISIS\n\n## STEP 1: ASSUMPTION AUDIT\n\n**Hidden Assumptions:**\n1. **All 30% excess patients require full admission** - Others assume bed shortages = need more beds\n   - *If wrong:* Many patients could be treated through expanded outpatient, observation units, or home care programs\n\n2. **Current bed utilization is optimized** - Others assume existing beds are being used efficiently\n   - *If wrong:* Significant capacity could be unlocked through better discharge planning, scheduling, and flow management\n\n3. **Revenue per patient is fixed** - Others assume current payer mix and pricing are unchangeable\n   - *If wrong:* Strategic shifts toward higher-margin services or better payer negotiations could dramatically improve finances\n\n4. **The crisis is permanent/growing** - Others assume current demand levels will persist or increase\n   - *If wrong:* This could be temporary (post-COVID surge, seasonal, demographic bubble) requiring different solutions\n\n5. **Build vs. bankruptcy are the only options** - Others see this as a binary choice\n   - *If wrong:* Multiple hybrid solutions exist that address both capacity and cash flow simultaneously\n\n## STEP 2: STRATEGIC DEPTH\n\n**2nd Order Consequences:**\n- Improved patient flow will reduce staff burnout and turnover, creating positive feedback loop\n- Successfully managing this crisis will strengthen board-CFO-medical staff relationships for future challenges\n- Community reputation impact will affect physician recruitment and patient choice\n\n**3rd Order Consequences:**\n- Market positioning: Competitors may gain permanent market share if crisis mishandled\n- Regulatory attention: Capacity issues may trigger state oversight or certificate of need complications\n- **Non-obvious downstream effect:** Success will create a replicable playbook for other hospitals facing similar crises, potentially creating consulting revenue opportunities\n\n## STEP 3: FRAME ALTERNATIVES\n\n**Frame 1:** Financial turnaround problem - Focus on cash flow and cost reduction\n**Frame 2:** Capacity optimization challenge - Focus on operational efficiency and patient flow\n**Frame 3:** **Strategic transformation opportunity** - Focus on care model innovation\n\n**Most Generative Frame: Strategic Transformation Opportunity**\nThis frame is most generative because it:\n- Addresses both immediate financial and capacity constraints\n- Opens possibilities for new revenue streams\n- Forces consideration of future healthcare trends (value-based care, outpatient shift)\n- Creates potential competitive advantages rather than just solving problems\n\n## STEP 4: ACTIONABLE SOLUTION\n\n**INTEGRATED CAPACITY & CASH STRATEGY**\n\n**Phase 1 (30 days): Emergency Stabilization**\n- **Who/What/When:** CFO leads daily cash management team, Medical Director leads capacity optimization team\n- Create \"virtual beds\" through 23-hour observation unit (convert existing space - $500K vs. $50M)\n- Implement discharge-by-noon protocol to increase bed turnover 15-20%\n- Launch ambulatory surgery expansion for procedures that don't require overnight stays\n\n**Phase 2 (90 days): Revenue Enhancement**\n- Partner with local skilled nursing facilities for step-down beds\n- Launch premium amenities program (private rooms, concierge services) for self-pay patients\n- Expand telemedicine follow-ups to reduce readmissions\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Reduce average length of stay by 0.5 days within 60 days\n- Increase effective bed capacity by 20% without new construction\n- Improve cash flow to 12-month runway within 90 days\n- Maintain patient satisfaction scores above 85th percentile\n\n**Contingency Plan:**\nIf targets aren't met by day 60: Activate partnership discussions with larger health system for merger/acquisition while still operational\n\n## STEP 5: SOLUTION VERIFICATION\n\n### CHECK A - ASSUMPTION STRESS TEST\n**Assumption 1:** Current bed utilization is optimized (30% probability wrong)\n- *If wrong:* Solution works even better - more capacity can be unlocked\n- *Adaptation:* Add bed utilization audit in first 15 days\n\n**Assumption 2:** Revenue per patient is fixed (40% probability wrong)\n- *If wrong:* Solution becomes more viable with additional revenue opportunities\n- *Adaptation:* Include payer mix analysis and pricing review in Phase 1\n\n### CHECK B - ADVERSARIAL SIMULATION\n**Adversary Strategy:** Competing hospitals could poach key physicians during crisis, worsening capacity and finances\n**Weakest Link:** Staff morale during high-stress transformation period\n**Safeguard:** Implement physician retention bonuses tied to transformation milestones and create physician advisory committee for solution input\n\n### CHECK C - CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION\n**Confidence Level:** 75% chance of success\n\n**Evidence for Higher Confidence:**\n- Board and medical staff full buy-in on transformation approach\n- Early wins in bed turnover metrics within 30 days\n- Successful ambulatory surgery conversions\n\n**Evidence for Lower Confidence:**\n- Staff resistance to workflow changes\n- Payer pushback on observation unit billing\n- Unexpected cash flow deterioration\n\n**Critical Unknown:** Staff and physician willingness to embrace rapid operational changes under financial pressure\n\n**Final Assessment:** Solution addresses both immediate crisis and long-term sustainability while maintaining optionality. The integrated approach reduces risk compared to single-focus strategies.",

      "problem": "A family business patriarch is dying. His three children hate each other. The business is worth $100M but illiquid. Two want to sell, one wants to keep it. The patriarch wants family unity above all. What should the family advisor recommend?",
      "solution": "# STRATEGIC PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL v5.2-V\n\n## STEP 1: ASSUMPTION AUDIT\n\n**Hidden Assumptions:**\n\n1. **The patriarch's definition of \"family unity\" means keeping everyone together in the business**\n   - *If wrong:* Unity might actually mean peaceful separation with mutual respect and financial security for all\n\n2. **The business's $100M valuation is accurate and stable**\n   - *If wrong:* Could be overvalued in current market conditions, affecting negotiation dynamics and exit strategies\n\n3. **\"Hate each other\" is permanent and irreconcilable**\n   - *If wrong:* The hatred might be situational grief/stress that could be addressed through professional mediation\n\n4. **The two who want to sell have purely financial motivations**\n   - *If wrong:* They might want out due to feeling excluded from decision-making or having different life goals\n\n5. **Liquidity is the primary obstacle to resolution**\n   - *If wrong:* The real issue might be control, legacy concerns, or unresolved family dynamics\n\n## STEP 2: STRATEGIC DEPTH\n\n**2nd Order Consequences:**\n- Creating a succession plan will force conversations about competency, vision, and values\n- Any solution will set precedent for how the next generation handles conflict\n- Financial restructuring will affect relationships with employees, customers, and creditors\n\n**3rd Order Consequences:**\n- The chosen path will influence how grandchildren view family business and wealth\n- Community standing and business reputation may shift based on family dynamics\n- Tax implications could affect family wealth for generations\n\n**Non-obvious Downstream Effect:**\nThe advisor's recommendation will fundamentally alter their role from neutral facilitator to decision influencer, potentially creating long-term liability and affecting their relationship with whichever parties feel disadvantaged.\n\n## STEP 3: FRAME ALTERNATIVES\n\n**Frame 1: Asset Division Problem**\nFocus on fair financial distribution and clean separation\n\n**Frame 2: Legacy Preservation Challenge**\nFocus on honoring patriarch's values while respecting individual autonomy\n\n**Frame 3: Family System Dysfunction** \nFocus on healing relationships first, business decisions second\n\n**Most Generative Frame: Legacy Preservation Challenge**\n\nThis frame acknowledges the patriarch's primary concern (unity) while recognizing that forced togetherness isn't unity. It opens space for creative solutions that preserve family connection through shared values rather than shared ownership.\n\n## STEP 4: ACTIONABLE SOLUTION\n\n**Recommendation: Structured Legacy Transition with Unity Covenant**\n\n**Structure:**\n- Create a family foundation funded by 20% of business value\n- Facilitate buyout of two children who want to sell (using combination of business cash flow, debt financing, and gradual payment plan)\n- Establish \"Family Unity Covenant\" - formal agreement for ongoing relationship, regular gatherings, and shared philanthropic mission\n\n**Clear First Step:**\nThe patriarch and family advisor will convene a facilitated family meeting within 2 weeks, led by a professional family business consultant, to present this framework and gauge initial reactions.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- All three children agree to participate in structured mediation within 30 days\n- Financial terms are agreed upon within 90 days\n- Family Unity Covenant is signed before patriarch's death\n- Business maintains operational stability throughout transition\n\n**Contingency:**\nIf mediation fails, implement \"Respectful Divorce\" protocol: professional third-party valuation, structured sale timeline, family foundation still established, annual family meetings continue with professional facilitation for 5 years minimum.\n\n## STEP 5: SOLUTION VERIFICATION\n\n### CHECK A - ASSUMPTION STRESS TEST:\n\n**Assumption 1 (Unity = Togetherness) - 60% chance it's wrong**\n- If wrong: Solution actually works better, as it redefines unity around shared values\n- Adaptation needed: Emphasize the covenant and foundation aspects more heavily\n\n**Assumption 3 (Permanent hatred) - 40% chance it's wrong**\n- If wrong: Solution becomes easier to implement with less resistance\n- Adaptation needed: Include relationship repair as explicit goal, not just damage control\n\n### CHECK B - ADVERSARIAL SIMULATION:\n\n**Opponent Strategy:** The child who wants to keep the business could refuse buyout terms, claiming inability to pay, forcing a sale of the entire business.\n\n**Weakest Link:** Financing the buyouts without destroying business cash flow\n\n**Specific Safeguard:** Include independent financial analysis with multiple financing options (SBA loans, private equity partnerships, earn-out structures) and establish maximum 7-year payment timeline with clear consequences for default.\n\n### CHECK C - CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:\n\n**Confidence Level:** 75%\n\n**Evidence to revise UP:** Children show willingness to engage in professional mediation; business has strong cash flows; patriarch actively supports the plan\n\n**Evidence to revise DOWN:** Children refuse mediation; business faces immediate liquidity crisis; patriarch's health deteriorates too rapidly for implementation\n\n**Most Important Unknown:** Whether the child keeping the business has the leadership capability and family credibility to actually run it successfully post-transition.\n\n**Final Assessment:** The solution balances the patriarch's unity desire with practical realities, creates multiple pathways to success, and preserves relationships even if the business relationship ends.",
