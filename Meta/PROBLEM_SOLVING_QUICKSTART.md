# Problem-Solving Quickstart
## The 2-Minute Version

### Step 1: Pick Your Tier

```
Can you state the solution in your head? → TIER 1
Multiple approaches exist? 2+ stakeholders? → TIER 2
Hidden constraints? Political? Expensive if wrong? → TIER 3
People disagree on what the problem IS? → TIER 4
```

### Step 2: Execute

**TIER 1** (<5 min)
```
State → Generate 2-3 → Pick → Verify
```

**TIER 2** (15-30 min)
```
Classify domain → Verify frame → State → Constraints →
Generate 3+ (distinct mechanisms) → Evaluate → Red-team → Select → Design
```

**TIER 3** (45-90 min)
```
All of Tier 2 PLUS:
Before: Meta-frame audit, Discover unknowns
After constraints: Stakeholder red-lines
After red-team: Frame-adequacy check
After select: Probe frame (prototype)
After design: Deployment probe, Stakeholder checkpoint
End: Handoff protocol
```

**TIER 4** (Multi-session)
```
All of Tier 3 PLUS:
Multi-frame protocol (map each stakeholder's problem)
Iterate loop (probe → sense → respond)
Mandatory incubation
Stopping criteria
```

### Step 3: Verify (Tier-Appropriate)

| Tier | Verification |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Does it answer the question? |
| 2 | + Would reasonable person object? + Survives a week? |
| 3 | + Works at scale? + Stakeholders accept? + Rollback possible? |
| 4 | + Frame holds? + Problem definitions converged? + Done or stabilized? |

### Step 4: Log

## The Three Rules

1. **Say the tier out loud** before starting (creates activation)
2. **If surprised mid-solve**, re-tier upward
3. **Log every significant problem** (how you learn)

---

## Quick Diagnostic

**If solution breaks during implementation:** You under-tiered
**If stakeholders reject it:** Missed stakeholder analysis
**If surprises emerge:** Missed discovery phase
**If people argue about "success":** Was actually Tier 4

---

## The One Insight

**Match rigor to stakes.** Tier 4 on Tier 1 problems is waste. Tier 1 on Tier 4 problems is disaster.
