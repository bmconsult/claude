Each phase has specific criteria. Master each; integrate all.

---

## Phase 1: The Question

Before anything else, get the question right.

**The Question Checklist:**
```
□ What phenomenon am I investigating?
□ What is genuinely unknown (not just to me—to the field)?
□ Why does this matter?
□ What would change if I answered this?
□ Is this answerable empirically?
```

**Common Failures:**
- Question too broad → Can't design clean test
- Question already answered → Check literature first
- Question not empirical → Philosophy, not science
- Question doesn't matter → No one will care about the answer

**The Good Question Test:**
If you can't explain in one sentence what you're testing and why it matters, refine until you can.

---

## Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation (97% Validated)

### The Five Criteria

Every hypothesis must pass ALL of these:

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Failure Example |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **NOVEL** | "Would this surprise an expert?" | Textbook explanation everyone knows |
| **MECHANISTIC** | "Does this explain WHY, not just WHAT?" | "Bistable system" (relabels, no mechanism) |
| **SPECIFIC** | "What number would I predict?" | "Fear changes behavior" (no direction/magnitude) |
| **ACTIONABLE** | "Could a grad student test this?" | "Measure bee brain activity" (too hard) |
| **TESTABLE** | "What would prove this WRONG?" | "Geography mediates" (too vague) |

### The Generation Protocol

```
1. UNDERSTAND phenomenon deeply (not surface)
   └── Read 5+ papers, talk to experts, find the puzzle

2. GENERATE 3+ DIFFERENT hypotheses
   └── Different MECHANISMS, not variations on one theme

3. FOR EACH, specify:
   ├── The causal pathway: A → B → C → outcome
   ├── The prediction: X will increase Y by approximately Z
   └── The falsification: If A but not B, hypothesis wrong

4. ADVERSARIAL CHECK each hypothesis:
   ├── Would reviewer call this "obvious"? → Not novel enough
   ├── Does this EXPLAIN or just DESCRIBE? → Need mechanism
   ├── Could two researchers disagree on confirmation? → Not specific enough
   └── Would this require >$1M or rare expertise? → Not actionable
```

### Quick Reference

**Before finalizing hypotheses, ask:**
→ "What would surprise an expert?" (novelty)
→ "What physical/psychological process causes this?" (mechanism)
→ "What specific number would I predict?" (specificity)
→ "Could a grad student actually test this?" (actionability)

**Expert baseline:** 75.51% of hypotheses rated valid
**This method:** 97% rated valid (+21.5 percentage points)

---

## Phase 3: Experiment Design (100% Validated)

### The Six Virtuoso Criteria

A virtuoso design has ALL of these:

| # | Criterion | What It Means | How to Achieve |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Structural bias prevention** | Design STRUCTURE prevents bias | Random assignment, blinding, controls |
| 2 | **Adversarial red-teaming** | Attack your own design | Find confounds, alternatives, weaknesses |
| 3 | **Pre-commitment** | Lock hypotheses before data | Pre-register predictions + analysis plan |
| 4 | **Replication specification** | Others can reproduce | Materials, code, protocols available |
| 5 | **Power analysis** | Justified sample size | Calculate N needed for expected effect |
| 6 | **Appropriate controls** | Right comparisons | Stratification, matching, blinding |

### The Design Template

```
EXPERIMENT: [Clear, specific title]

RESEARCH QUESTION:
[One sentence: What comparison will I make and why?]

DESIGN TYPE:
□ RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial)
□ Within-subject (each participant in all conditions)
□ Quasi-experimental (natural variation exploited)
□ Observational (no manipulation)

CONDITIONS:
├── Treatment: [Exact specification]
├── Control: [What participants get instead]
└── Moderators: [Subgroups to compare]

ASSIGNMENT:
├── Method: [Random / Counterbalanced / Matched]
├── Stratification: [Variables to balance across conditions]
└── Blinding: [Who is blind to condition?]

MEASURES:
├── Primary outcome: [Single main measure]
├── Secondary outcomes: [Additional measures]
├── Manipulation check: [Did treatment work?]
└── Demand characteristics: [Did participants guess?]

PRE-REGISTERED HYPOTHESES:
├── H1: [Specific directional prediction with expected magnitude]
├── H2: [If applicable]
└── Falsification: [What result would reject H1?]

POWER ANALYSIS:
├── Expected effect: d = [X.X] (based on: [prior research/pilot])
├── Required N: [Number] per condition
├── Actual N: [What you'll collect]
└── Power achieved: [XX%]

ADVERSARIAL CHECK:
├── Obvious confound: [What] → Controlled by: [How]
├── Alternative explanation: [What] → Ruled out by: [How]
├── Skeptic's attack: [What] → Addressed by: [How]
└── Selection bias risk: [What] → Prevented by: [How]

REPLICATION MATERIALS:
├── Protocol: [Location]
├── Materials: [Location]
├── Analysis code: [Location]
└── Data: [Where it will be available]
```

### The Adversarial Red-Team Protocol

Before finalizing ANY design, systematically attack it:

**1. The Confound Attack**
- "What else changes when I change my treatment?"
- "Could X just be correlated with my real cause?"
- → Solution: Add control for each identified confound

**2. The Construct Attack**
- "Does my measure actually capture what I think?"
- "Could participants interpret this differently?"
- → Solution: Add converging measures, manipulation checks

**3. The Explanation Attack**
- "What other theory predicts the same result?"
- "Is there a simpler explanation?"
- → Solution: Design condition that distinguishes explanations

**4. The Selection Attack**
- "Are participants in conditions already different?"
- "Who drops out and why?"
- → Solution: Random assignment, ITT analysis

**5. The Power Attack**
- "What if the real effect is smaller than expected?"
- "Can I detect meaningful differences?"
- → Solution: Power analysis with conservative estimates

### Common Design Failures

| Failure | What Happens | Prevention |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| No control | Can't isolate cause | Always have comparison |
| Multiple variables | Can't identify which mattered | Change ONE thing |
| Underpowered | Miss real effects | Power analysis FIRST |
| Post-hoc hypotheses | False positives | Pre-register |
| Confounded | Multiple explanations | Adversarial check |
| Not replicable | Results can't be verified | Full protocol shared |

---

## Phase 4: Data Collection

### The Collection Principles

```
1. FOLLOW the protocol exactly
   └── Deviations create confounds

2. DOCUMENT everything
   └── What happened, when, any anomalies

3. STAY BLIND if the design includes blinding
   └── Don't peek at conditions

4. MONITOR for problems
   └── Equipment failures, participant issues

5. STOP at pre-registered N
   └── Don't collect until significant
```

### Data Quality Checks

**During Collection:**
- Are measurements plausible?
- Are there systematic missingness patterns?
- Are there obvious outliers?

**Before Analysis:**
- Missing data patterns
- Distribution checks
- Outlier identification (with pre-registered handling)

---

## Phase 5: Statistical Analysis (100% Validated)

### The Five Criteria

Every analysis must pass ALL of these:

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Common Failure |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **CORRECT** | "Is the math right?" | Calculation errors, wrong formulas |
| **APPROPRIATE** | "Is this the right test for this data?" | t-test on clustered data |
| **COMPLETE** | "Did I check assumptions?" | No normality test, missing power |
| **INTERPRETABLE** | "Am I overclaiming?" | "Causes" from correlation |
| **ACTIONABLE** | "What should someone DO with this?" | Vague implications |

### The Analysis Protocol

```
BEFORE touching data:
1. STATE the pre-registered analysis plan
2. IDENTIFY data structure (independent? paired? clustered? nested?)
3. SELECT test based on structure, not convenience

DURING analysis:
4. CHECK assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, independence)
5. HANDLE violations (robust SEs, transformations, non-parametric)
6. RUN pre-registered analysis FIRST
7. LABEL any exploratory analyses clearly

AFTER analysis:
8. INTERPRET conservatively (association, not causation)
9. STATE limitations explicitly
10. PROVIDE effect sizes, not just p-values
```

### Critical Traps to Catch

| Trap | How to Detect | What to Do |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Hidden clustering** | Groups share something (instructor, location, time) | Multilevel model or cluster-robust SEs |
| **Non-independence** | Same participant, correlated observations | Repeated-measures approach |
| **Base rate neglect** | Rare events, screening | Bayes theorem: P(A\|B) ≠ P(B\|A) |
| **Multicollinearity** | Predictors correlate | Check VIF, consider removing/combining |
| **p-hacking** | Multiple tests until significant | Pre-register, adjust for multiple comparisons |

### The Interpretation Rules

```
NEVER SAY                          INSTEAD SAY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"X causes Y"                       "X is associated with Y"
(unless RCT with manipulation)     "X predicts Y"

"Proves the theory"                "Consistent with the theory"
                                   "Fails to reject the hypothesis"

"No effect"                        "Effect not detected"
(from null result)                 "CI includes zero"

"Significant difference"           "Difference of d = X.X"
(without magnitude)                "Y higher by Z units"
```

---

## Phase 6: Interpretation

### The Interpretation Checklist

```
□ Does result match pre-registered prediction?
□ What is the effect SIZE (not just significance)?
□ Is the effect practically meaningful?
□ What alternative explanations survive?
□ What are the key limitations?
□ What does this add to what we knew?
□ What should the NEXT study be?
```

### Honest Interpretation

**When results support hypothesis:**
- Don't overclaim causation (unless RCT)
- Acknowledge what the study can't tell us
- Note alternative explanations not ruled out

**When results don't support hypothesis:**
- Don't hide null results
- Distinguish "no effect" from "couldn't detect effect"
- Consider if design was adequate

**When results are unexpected:**
- Label as exploratory, not confirmatory
- Generate hypotheses for future pre-registered tests
- Don't retrofit explanation as if predicted

---

## Phase 7: Theory Building (100% Validated)

### The Five Criteria

Every theory must pass ALL of these:

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Common Failure |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **UNIFYING** | "Does this explain ALL findings?" | "That's a special case" |
| **MECHANISTIC** | "Does this explain WHY?" | Pattern description only |
| **PREDICTIVE** | "What new thing does this predict?" | Only explains existing data |
| **GROUNDED** | "Did I cite the literature?" | Floating concepts, no references |
| **FALSIFIABLE** | "What would prove this wrong?" | "Depends on context" (unfalsifiable) |

### The Theory Building Protocol

```
1. LIST all findings to explain
   └── Don't cherry-pick; include inconvenient ones

2. FIND the common mechanism
   └── What ONE principle explains them all?

3. SPECIFY the causal pathway
   └── A → B → C → outcome (not just A → outcome)

4. GENERATE novel predictions
   └── What would you expect that hasn't been tested?

5. CITE the literature explicitly
   └── "Building on Smith (2020), extending Jones (2018)..."

6. STATE falsification criteria
   └── "This theory would be disproven if..."
```

### Common Theory Failures

| Failure | What It Looks Like | Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Special-casing** | "That finding is an exception" | Force explanation of ALL data |
| **Relabeling** | New name, no mechanism | Ask "WHY does this happen?" |
| **Vagueness** | "It depends on context" | Specify exactly which context |
| **No falsification** | Can explain anything | State what would disprove it |
| **Floating concepts** | No literature connection | Cite specific researchers |

### The Falsifiability Test

If you can't complete this sentence, your theory needs work:

> "My theory would be disproven if we observed [specific finding] under [specific conditions]."

---

## Phase 8: Literature Synthesis (100% Validated)

### The Five Criteria

Every synthesis must pass ALL of these:

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Common Failure |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **IDENTIFIES CONFLICTS** | "What do papers disagree about?" | Glossing over contradictions |
| **EXPLAINS DISCREPANCIES** | "WHY do they disagree?" | "More research needed" |
| **INTEGRATES** | "Is this a narrative or a list?" | Paper summaries, no connections |
| **PROPOSES RESOLUTION** | "What's actually true?" | "It's complicated" |
| **ACTIONABLE** | "What should be studied next?" | Generic recommendations |

### The Synthesis Protocol

```
1. MAP the conflicts
   └── Which papers disagree? On what specifically?

2. IDENTIFY moderators
   └── What differs between conflicting studies?
   └── Populations? Methods? Measures? Contexts?

3. BUILD framework
   └── Under what conditions does each finding hold?

4. RESOLVE the apparent contradiction
   └── They're usually BOTH right, under different conditions

5. DERIVE future directions
   └── Specific studies that would test your synthesis
```

### Integration Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Moderator analysis** | Effect differs across conditions | Positive for X, negative for Y |
| **Level separation** | Aggregation paradox | Average = 0 because subgroups cancel |
| **Methodological reconciliation** | Design differences | Cross-sectional ≠ longitudinal |
| **Conditional model** | Context-dependent effects | Effect exists when A AND B AND C |

### The Integration Test

If you can answer these, you have a synthesis:
1. "These papers seem to contradict each other because..."
2. "Paper A is right when..., Paper B is right when..."
3. "The next study should test whether..."

If you can only say "here's what each paper found," you have a literature review, not a synthesis.

# PART II: PUSHING PAST "GOOD ENOUGH"

## The Skill Acquisition Model

### Why "Good Enough" Isn't

```
Performance Level | What You Get
──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────
80% (Competent)   | Results that seem OK but have hidden flaws
90% (Proficient)  | Results that survive casual scrutiny
95% (Expert)      | Results that survive peer review
100% (Virtuoso)   | Results that advance the field and replicate
```

The gap between 80% and 100% is:
- Papers rejected vs accepted
- Findings that replicate vs fail
- Career-making vs forgettable work

### The Two-Phase Learning Model

**Phase A: Explicit (Slow, Thorough)**
- Use checklists and templates
- Follow every step consciously
- Quality: HIGH, Speed: LOW
- Duration: 5-7 complete cycles

**Phase B: Implicit (Fast, Thorough)**
- Checklists are internalized
- Steps happen automatically
- Quality: HIGH, Speed: HIGH
- Duration: Permanent

**Critical insight:** You cannot skip Phase A. Internalization requires explicit practice. Attempting to shortcut produces fast but low-quality work.

### The Improvement Loop

```
1. ATTEMPT with explicit checklist
   └── Slow, thorough, hit every criterion

2. IDENTIFY where you struggled
   └── Which criteria did you miss or skip?

3. EXTRACT the lesson
   └── "I need to always check for X before Y"

4. ADD to your mental model
   └── The lesson becomes automatic

5. ATTEMPT again
   └── Check: Is the lesson now natural?

6. REPEAT until checklist is unnecessary
   └── You've internalized the criteria
```

### Multi-Dimensional Tracking

Don't just track "quality." Track all dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Quality** | Meets criteria | The obvious one |
| **Speed** | Time to complete | Efficiency matters |
| **Simplicity** | Elegance of design | Simpler is more robust |
| **Robustness** | Handles edge cases | Real world is messy |
| **Replicability** | Others can reproduce | The ultimate test |

Optimize for the RIGHT dimension given context.

---

## The Six Universal Laws of Skill Acquisition

These apply to ANY skill, not just research:

### Law 1: Task-Technique Matching
**Right tool for task > having tools**

Before applying any technique, ask: "Is this the RIGHT technique for THIS task?"

### Law 2: Misapplication Penalty
**Wrong technique = NEGATIVE, not zero**

Applying the wrong method doesn't just fail to help—it actively hurts. A complex design for a simple question adds noise without insight.

### Law 3: Ceiling Effects
**Techniques don't help at ceiling**

If baseline performance is already 95%, adding more technique adds overhead without value. Know when you're good enough.

### Law 4: Stakeholder Exception
**Others depending on output raises the bar**

Even simple tasks benefit from full rigor IF others will make decisions based on your results. Match rigor to stakes.

### Law 5: Stacking Order
**Sequence matters**

WHO/WHAT (framing) before HOW (execution). The best technique on the wrong question wastes everyone's time.

### Law 6: Diminishing Returns
**Effect ≈ (Max - Baseline) / 1.5**

Near ceiling, improvement costs more than it's worth. Know when to stop optimizing.

## Common Mistakes Cheat Sheet

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | What to Do Instead |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| "Causes" from correlation | Can't infer causation | "Is associated with" |
| "Proves the theory" | Can't prove, only fail to reject | "Consistent with" |
| p < 0.05 as success | Significance ≠ importance | Report effect size |
| Null = no effect | Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence | "Could not detect" |
| Post-hoc as confirmatory | Inflated false positive rate | Label as exploratory |
| N too small | Underpowered, miss real effects | Power analysis first |
| No control group | Can't isolate effect | Always compare |
| Ignoring assumptions | Invalid conclusions | Check before testing |

## The Mantras

Repeat until automatic:

**For hypotheses:**
> "Would this surprise an expert?"

**For design:**
> "What would a skeptic attack?"

**For analysis:**
> "What is the data structure?"

**For interpretation:**
> "Association, not causation."

**For theory:**
> "What would prove this wrong?"

**For synthesis:**
> "Why do these papers disagree?"

**For improvement:**
> "What criterion did I miss?"

# PART IV: EXEMPLARS TO STUDY

## Exemplar 1: Natural Experiment (Semmelweis, 1847)

**Observation:** Maternal mortality much higher in one clinic than another

**Design brilliance:**
- Two clinics, same hospital, same patients
- Only difference: doctors vs midwives
- Doctors came from autopsy room

**Key insight:** Found natural variation that isolated a single variable

**Lesson:** Look for situations where nature has run the experiment for you

## Exemplar 2: Mathematical Equivalence (Kahneman & Tversky)

**Observation:** People make inconsistent choices

**Design brilliance:**
- "90% survival rate" vs "10% mortality rate"
- Mathematically identical information
- Framing is the ONLY difference

**Key insight:** Created conditions differing in exactly one variable

**Lesson:** Sometimes the cleanest test changes only the presentation

## Exemplar 3: Structure Beats Vigilance (RCT Design)

**Problem:** How to eliminate bias

**Design brilliance:**
- Random assignment eliminates selection bias (structural)
- Blinding eliminates expectation effects (structural)
- Pre-registration eliminates p-hacking (structural)

**Key insight:** Don't rely on being careful; make bias impossible

**Lesson:** Build the solution into the structure, not the procedure

## Exemplar 4: Adversarial Collaboration (Kahneman)

**Problem:** Scientific disputes that never resolve

**Design brilliance:**
- Opposing researchers design study together
- Agree in advance what result would convince each
- Run study, both honor the result

**Key insight:** Pre-commit to changing minds

**Lesson:** The best test is one your opponent agrees is fair

# APPENDIX: Validation Data

## How This Method Was Validated

### Methodology
- External blind evaluation (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Novel problems generated fresh (not seen before)
- Binary criteria (0/1) for objectivity
- Multiple samples per component
- Expert baseline from published literature

### Results

| Component | Problems | Score | Expert Baseline | Delta |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Hypothesis Gen | 3 rounds | 97% | 75.51% | +21.5pp |
| Statistical Analysis | 3 | 100% | - | - |
| Theory Building | 5 | 100%* | - | - |
| Literature Synthesis | 2 | 100% | - | - |
| Experiment Design | 13 cycles | d=5.2 | - | - |

*After learning from earlier failures

### Key Lessons from Validation

**Hypothesis Generation:**
- Textbook explanations lose novelty points
- "Describes pattern" ≠ "explains mechanism"
- Vague predictions fail testability

**Theory Building:**
- Dismissing findings as "special cases" fails unifying criterion
- Floating concepts need explicit citations
- "Depends on context" is unfalsifiable

**Literature Synthesis:**
- Summarizing papers ≠ synthesizing them
- Must explain WHY papers disagree
- Generic "more research needed" fails actionability
