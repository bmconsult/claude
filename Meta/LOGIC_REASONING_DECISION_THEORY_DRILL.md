# Decision Theory Failure Mode - Targeted Training

## The Failure

In Cycle 7, I got 1/3 on a Newcomb-variant problem. My error:

**My answer**: Two-box because quantum randomness breaks prediction mechanism
**Evaluator's view**: One-box because 100% empirical track record should dominate

## The Core Issue

I assumed **causal decision theory (CDT)** was correct:
- My choice can't affect past prediction
- Quantum randomness means no causal pathway
- Therefore two-box (dominance reasoning)

The evaluator applied **evidential decision theory (EDT)**:
- The empirical correlation (100% accuracy) is what matters
- If one-boxers consistently get $1M, be a one-boxer
- Doesn't matter "how" the correlation works

## The Lesson

**Both frameworks are philosophically legitimate.** I should NOT assume one is "correct."

### When to Apply Each

**CDT says two-box when:**
- You believe only causal effects matter
- Your choice cannot cause the prediction to change
- Standard physics applies

**EDT says one-box when:**
- Empirical correlations should guide action
- 100% track record is overwhelming evidence
- Don't need to understand mechanism

**Functional Decision Theory (FDT) might say:**
- What decision procedure maximizes utility across similar scenarios?
- If being the "type of agent who one-boxes" leads to better outcomes...

## Process Upgrade

**For ALL Newcomb-style problems:**

```
□ Identify the tension (correlation vs causation)
□ Present the CDT argument explicitly
□ Present the EDT argument explicitly
□ If relevant, present FDT/UDT perspective
□ Note which framework the problem seems to favor
□ If forced to choose, explain WHY you're choosing that framework
□ Acknowledge the philosophical debate is unsettled
```

## Practice Problem

**Setup**: A demon accurately predicts whether you'll press a button. If it predicts you'll press, it gives you $100 now. The button, if pressed, destroys $1000 of yours.

**CDT**: Don't press. You have the $100 (or don't). Pressing destroys $1000 regardless.

**EDT**: The correlation is: button-pressers got $100, non-pressers didn't. Press to be in the "got $100" reference class? No - because NOW you see whether you have $100. The correlation was about prediction, not action.

**Resolution**: This is Evidential Blackmail. EDT actually agrees with CDT here because conditioning happens on current evidence (whether you have $100), not just on your action type.

## Key Patterns

| Scenario | CDT says | EDT says | Tension |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Standard Newcomb | Two-box | One-box | High |
| Newcomb + quantum | Two-box | One-box (empirical) | Moderate |
| Evidential blackmail | Don't press | Don't press (update on current state) | Low |
| Prisoner's dilemma | Defect | Cooperate (if correlated) | Moderate |
| Smoking lesion | Smoke if you want | Don't smoke | High |

## Internalized Rule

**NEVER assume CDT or EDT is "obviously correct."**

Both have strong arguments. The "right" answer often depends on:
1. What you think rationality means
2. Whether you think acausal correlations should guide action
3. Your metaphysical views on causation and time

**When in doubt: present both sides clearly, then explain your reasoning.**
