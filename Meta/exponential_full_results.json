  "final_strategy": "## ADVERSARIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v7.0\n\n**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Assume every solution will be gamed, every assumption will be wrong, and every system will face hostile conditions.\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n1. **ADVERSARIAL FRAME**: \n   - What type? What's success? What constraints?\n   - **WHO BENEFITS FROM FAILURE?** What actors have incentives to break this?\n   - What assumptions am I making that are probably wrong?\n   - What would the opposite approach look like?\n   - **LEGITIMACY SCAN**: Who needs to accept this for it to work? What would make them reject it as illegitimate?\n\n2. **GENERATE WITH FORCED DIVERSITY**:\n   - Standard approach (what most people would do)\n   - **DOMAIN TRANSPLANT**: How would a completely different field solve this? (Pick: military, biology, economics, game design)\n   - **ASSUMPTION INVERSION**: What if my key assumption is backwards?\n   - **HOSTILE ACTOR APPROACH**: How would someone trying to exploit this system design it?\n   - **ANTIFRAGILE VARIANT**: What version gets stronger when attacked or stressed?\n\n3. **DEEP CONSEQUENCE MAPPING**:\n   - For top 2 approaches: Effect \u2192 2nd order effect \u2192 3rd order effect \u2192 4th order effect\n   - **ECOSYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS**: What adjacent systems/stakeholders are affected? How do they respond? What feedback loops emerge?\n   - **ADVERSARIAL STRESS TEST**: How would bad actors game each approach? What would they optimize for?\n   - **FAILURE CASCADE**: If this fails, what fails next? And then what?\n   - **ELEGANCE FILTER**: What's the 20% that delivers 80% of the value?\n   - **STRESS BENEFIT ANALYSIS**: What stresses/attacks could actually make this stronger? How?\n\n4. **ADAPTIVE SELECTION**:\n   - Choose approach that survives adversarial stress test best\n   - **REVERSIBILITY DESIGN**: Build in explicit undo mechanisms, rollback points, and exit strategies from the start\n   - **INCENTIVE ARCHITECTURE**: Map all stakeholder incentives - design so self-interest naturally supports the goal rather than fighting it\n   - **GRACEFUL DEGRADATION**: Design failure modes that maintain core function even under stress (what's the minimum viable version?)\n   - **GENERATIVE SCAFFOLDING**: What positive behaviors/outcomes could this enable beyond the immediate goal? How can it create beneficial side effects?\n   - **BUILD IN IMMUNE SYSTEM**: How will this detect and respond to gaming/changing conditions?\n   - **TRIPWIRES**: What early signals indicate this is failing or being gamed?\n   - **ANTIFRAGILE MECHANISMS**: Build in 3 ways this gets stronger from stress: overcompensation triggers, redundancy that activates under pressure, learning systems that improve from attacks\n   - **LEGITIMACY ANCHORS**: Root authority in widely accepted principles, create transparent processes, build in stakeholder voice/consent mechanisms\n   - **RAPID FEEDBACK LOOPS**: Design 3 fast feedback mechanisms (real-time metrics, user signals, system health indicators) with <24hr detection cycles\n   - **COMPOSABILITY INTERFACES**: Create standard connection points, shared protocols, and modular components that other systems can easily integrate with\n   - **TIMELESS CORE**: Identify the unchanging human/physical principles this relies on, minimize dependencies on current technology/culture, build on patterns that have worked across centuries\n\n5. **RED TEAM VERIFICATION**:\n   - All constraints met? Implementable by stranger?\n   - **GAMING SIMULATION**: Spend 2 minutes actively trying to break/exploit this solution\n   - **CONDITION CHANGE TEST**: How does this perform if 2 key assumptions become false?\n   - **ECOSYSTEM STRESS TEST**: What happens if adjacent systems change or push back?\n   - **REVERSIBILITY TEST**: Can this actually be undone cleanly? What are the switching costs?\n   - **INCENTIVE ALIGNMENT CHECK**: Do all key actors genuinely benefit from making this work?\n   - **NOVELTY CHECK**: Would this surprise someone expert in the domain?\n   - **ANTIFRAGILE VERIFICATION**: Simulate 3 different attacks/stresses - does this actually get stronger?\n   - **LEGITIMACY STRESS TEST**: What would make key stakeholders withdraw support? How robust is acceptance?\n   - **FEEDBACK SPEED TEST**: How quickly would you detect if this was failing? Can you measure success/failure in real-time?\n   - **INTEGRATION TEST**: How easily could this connect to 3 different existing systems?\n   - **TIME HORIZON TEST**: What would need to change for this to stop working in 50 years? How likely is that?\n\n6. **ADAPTIVE META**:\n   - What worked? What insight transfers to other problems?\n   - **STRATEGY EVOLUTION**: Based on this problem, what one change would improve this strategy?\n   - **CRITERIA SCORECARD**: Rate solution 1-3 on Antifragile/Legitimacy/Feedback-Rich/Composable/Timeless\n   - **EMERGENCE POTENTIAL**: What unexpected positive outcomes might this create? How can we amplify them?\n   - **PATTERN EXTRACTION**: What timeless patterns did this solution use? How can they be reapplied?\n\n**EMERGENCY SIMPLIFICATION PROTOCOL**: If analysis paralysis hits, immediately jump to: \"What would an adversary do?\" and \"What's the simplest version that could work, be easily undone, and get stronger from attacks?\""
