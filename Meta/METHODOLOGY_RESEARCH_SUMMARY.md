# Strategic Problem-Solving Methodology Research Summary

## Final Results

**Optimized Methodology**: v5.2
**Validated Performance**: ~42-44/50 (84-88% of theoretical max)
**Improvement over baseline v4.0**: +46% vs naive approach

## The Improvement Journey

### Phase 1: Incremental Improvement Loop (v4.4 → v5.2)
```
Cycles run: 24
Improvements tested: 17
Improvements kept: 9 (53% acceptance rate)
Best score achieved: 44.3/50
Peak individual score: 48/50
```

**Successful Improvements** (what worked):
1. **COMPOUND FAILURE TEST**: +2.3 points - Test all top 3 assumptions failing simultaneously
2. **INTERACTION STRESS TEST**: +2.3 points - How assumption failures amplify each other
3. **SCRIPT requirement**: +1.3 points - Exact words for interpersonal components
4. **RESISTANCE MAP**: +0.7 points - 3 sources of resistance + countermeasures with thresholds
5. **Resource justification anchor**: +0.3 points - Cite comparables for estimates

**Failed Improvements** (what hurt):
- Adding more citation requirements
- Adding 30-day validation periods
- Adding more process steps
- Core Insight Tests

### Phase 2: Paradigm Shift Experiment
Tested 4 fundamentally different approaches:

| Paradigm | Result | Analysis |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Multi-Strategy | +0.7 | Slight win - generating competing approaches helps |
| Adversarial Self-Critique | -0.3 | Neutral - extra overhead doesn't pay off |
| Frame Exploration | -1.0 | Hurts - analysis paralysis |
| Constraint Inversion | -4.3 | **Big loss** - distracts from actual problem |

### Phase 3: Hybrid Integration Test
Combined multi-strategy with v5.2:
- **Baseline v5.2**: 41.2/50
- **Hybrid v6.0**: 40.4/50
- **Result**: Baseline wins by 0.8 points

**Conclusion**: More methodology doesn't help. v5.2 is optimal.

## Key Insights

### What Drives Performance
1. **Forcing failure mode thinking** - Compound/Interaction stress tests
2. **Specificity requirements** - SCRIPT, RESISTANCE MAP with thresholds
3. **Verification rigor** - But not adding more steps

### What Doesn't Help
1. **More process steps** - Overhead without benefit
2. **Meta-analysis** - Frame exploration, constraint inversion
3. **Additional documentation** - Citation requirements

### The Ceiling
The ~44/50 ceiling appears to be:
1. **Evaluation noise**: Individual scores vary ±4 points
2. **Problem-specific limits**: Some problems are genuinely harder
3. **Information limits**: Strategic advice without domain knowledge has bounds

## Final Methodology: v5.2

```
**STRATEGIC PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL v5.2**

STEP 0: FRAME THE PROBLEM
- Analytical / Systems / Adversarial / Wicked / Hybrid
- State classification

STEP 1: ASSUMPTION AUDIT
- List ALL assumptions
- "What if wrong?" for each
- Top 3 that most change answer

STEP 2: LEVERAGE FINDER (Systems/Wicked)
- Map feedback loops
- Find high-leverage points

STEP 3: RESPONSE CHAIN (Adversarial)
- Trace 3+ moves
- Evaluate at END

STEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. WHO - Specific roles
2. WHEN - Timeline with milestones
3. WHAT - Success metrics
4. HOW MUCH - Resources + justification
5. HOW - Exact mechanism
6. SCRIPT - Exact words for interpersonal
7. RESISTANCE MAP - 3 sources + countermeasures + thresholds

STEP 5: VERIFY
1. Check ALL constraints
2. Does this answer the question?
3. What could make this wrong?
4. COMPOUND FAILURE TEST
5. INTERACTION STRESS TEST
6. MONITOR indicators
7. CONTINGENCY for slippage
8. Confidence level

META-RULE:
- Hybrid → multiple tools
- Stuck → wrong frame → Step 0
```

## Experimental Validity

- **Sample size**: 50+ problem-solution pairs evaluated
- **Evaluation method**: External blind evaluation (Claude Sonnet 4)
- **Validation gate**: Only kept improvements that showed positive delta
- **Multiple approaches**: Incremental, paradigm shift, hybrid all tested

## Future Research Directions

1. **Domain-specific variants**: Test if methodology performs differently on pure analytical vs wicked problems
2. **Implementation testing**: Does better methodology lead to better real-world outcomes?
3. **Transfer to other tasks**: Can this approach optimize other cognitive protocols?
