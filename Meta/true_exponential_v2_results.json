  "final_method": "PROBLEM-SOLVING METHOD:\n\n1. UNDERSTAND: What's the actual problem? What does success look like?\n2. CONSTRAINTS: What must be true? What can't we change?\n3. GENERATE: 3 different approaches, including one unconventional\n4. EVALUATE: For each approach - what's the main failure mode? What assumption might be wrong? **Test each against 2-3 realistic scenarios where the approach would be stressed or challenged. Score each approach 1-10 on feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness. Eliminate any approach scoring below 6 on any dimension.**\n5. SELECT: Pick best, explicitly address top failure mode\n6. BIAS CHECK: What human biases, conflicts of interest, or systemic unfairness could emerge? How will you detect and counter them? **Specifically address how wealthy/powerful interests might subvert the system and how monitoring bodies themselves could be captured over time.**\n7. OPERATIONALIZE: What specific processes, responsibilities, and protocols are needed for day-to-day implementation? **Detail all selection mechanisms, voting procedures, and threshold calculations.** Include monitoring/enforcement mechanisms and integration with existing systems.\n8. ADAPT: How will the system handle changes over time? Define mechanisms for mid-cycle adjustments, usage monitoring, and reallocation based on actual demand patterns. Address dynamic re-evaluation triggers and cross-jurisdictional coordination. **Complete all adaptation scenarios - don't leave incomplete. Include graduated response mechanisms for different magnitudes of change.**\n9. GAMING RESISTANCE: How could actors strategically manipulate timing, thresholds, or procedures? What prevents coordinated gaming of numerical boundaries? **Design specific countermeasures for each identified gaming vector.**\n10. VALUE SHIFT PROTOCOLS: How does the system handle fundamental shifts in societal values or priorities across generations? Define mechanisms for legitimate value evolution vs. temporary sentiment changes. **Specify multi-tier thresholds: lower bars for incremental adjustments, higher bars for fundamental changes, and emergency protocols for crisis-driven shifts.**\n11. FAILURE MODES: What happens when the system breaks down? Define escalation paths, conflict resolution mechanisms, and protocols for edge cases (poor performers, disputes, misuse). **Include enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance by authorities.**\n12. EXTERNAL COORDINATION: How does this system interact with other jurisdictions, organizations, or international bodies? What happens when external actors don't cooperate? **Design coordination mechanisms that maintain system integrity even when external partners change their approaches.**\n13. CALIBRATE: Justify key numerical thresholds, scoring margins, and decision boundaries with evidence or validation methods. How will these parameters be tested and refined?\n14. COMPLETENESS CHECK: Review each step for incomplete sentences, undefined processes, or vague mechanisms. **Ensure every threshold has a clear rationale, every process has defined actors and timelines, and every \"mechanism\" is specified in operational detail.**\n15. VERIFY: Does it solve the original problem? Test against constraints. Calculate implementation costs vs. benefits. **Re-run the stress scenarios from step 4 on the final solution. If any component lacks concrete detail or remains vague, return to that step and specify exactly how it would work in practice.**"
