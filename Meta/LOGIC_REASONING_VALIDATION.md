# Logic and Reasoning Mastery: Self-Validation Log

## Results Summary

| Cycle | Score | Type | Key Findings |
|-------|-------|------|--------------|
| 1 | 26/26 (100%) | Standard | Baseline - possibly too easy |
| 2 | 16/18 (89%) | Adversarial | Found real failure modes |
| 3 | 4/4 (100%) | Targeted | Process upgrades effective |

**Total: 46/48 (96%) across 16 problems**

## The Exponential Loop in Action

```
Cycle 1: Test baseline → 100% but problems too easy
    ↓
Cycle 2: Harder problems → 89%, found 3 failure modes
    ↓
Upgrade process: Added verification checklist
    ↓
Cycle 3: Target failure modes → 100%, upgrades validated
```

**Key insight:** The improvement came from UPGRADING THE PROCESS, not just practicing more. Each cycle identified specific weaknesses and added specific fixes.

## Identified Failure Modes

### 1. ARITHMETIC TRANSCRIPTION ERROR
**Problem:** Wrote 0.0238 when calculated 0.02376 in P2
**Root Cause:** Copying intermediate results without verification
**Upgrade:** Always verify final arithmetic by recalculating key numbers

### 2. INSUFFICIENT DEPTH ON PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS
**Problem:** Position on identity (P6) not fully developed
**Root Cause:** Stated position without deeply engaging counterarguments
**Upgrade:** For philosophical problems, explicitly address: "What is the strongest objection to my view? Why do I reject it?"

### 3. MISSING PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
**Problem:** Didn't quantify ER response time life-safety difference (P5)
**Root Cause:** Focused on abstract bias identification, missed concrete stakes
**Upgrade:** For decision problems, always ask: "What are the real-world stakes of each outcome?"

## Process Upgrades (from Cycle 2)

**ADDED TO REASONING CHECKLIST:**
```
□ VERIFY arithmetic by recalculating (don't just copy)
□ For philosophical positions: Address strongest counterargument explicitly
□ For decisions: Quantify real-world stakes of each option
□ Before submitting: One final pass for transcription errors
```

## Experimental Design

### Objective
Achieve validated mastery in logic and reasoning through recursive self-improvement cycles, using external blind evaluation (Opus 4.5) to measure progress.

### The Exponential Multiplier
Each cycle improves logic/reasoning ability → Better test design → Faster improvement → Compound gains

### Validation Criteria (Binary Scoring)

**For Deductive Reasoning:**
| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| VALID_ID | Correctly identifies whether argument is valid/invalid |
| FORM_ID | Correctly identifies the logical form |
| FLAW_ID | Correctly identifies specific flaw if invalid |
| COMPLETE | Addresses all relevant aspects |

**For Inductive Reasoning:**
| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| STRENGTH | Correctly assesses argument strength |
| BASE_RATE | Properly incorporates base rates |
| ALTERNATIVES | Identifies alternative explanations |
| SAMPLE | Correctly evaluates sample quality |

**For Probabilistic Reasoning:**
| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| CALCULATION | Math is correct |
| FRAMEWORK | Uses appropriate framework (Bayes, etc.) |
| INTERPRETATION | Correctly interprets result |
| CALIBRATION | Confidence matches evidence |

**For Causal Reasoning:**
| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| DIRECTION | Correctly identifies causal direction issues |
| CONFOUNDS | Identifies relevant confounders |
| MECHANISM | Evaluates mechanistic plausibility |
| EVIDENCE | Correctly assesses evidence quality |

### Protocol
1. Opus 4.5 generates novel problems I haven't seen
2. I solve them with full externalized reasoning
3. Opus 4.5 evaluates against criteria (blind to my self-assessment)
4. Score calculated, failure modes identified
5. Process upgraded based on failures
6. Repeat with harder problems
