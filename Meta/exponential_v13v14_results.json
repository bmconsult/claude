  "final_strategy": "# ADVERSARIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v17.0\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLE\nAssume every solution will be gamed, every assumption will be wrong, and every system will face hostile conditions. Design for reality, not ideals\u2014and for the people who come after you.\n\n## THE PROCESS\n\n### 1. FRAME THE ADVERSARIAL CONTEXT\n- **Problem + success criteria + constraints** (one sentence each)\n- **Who benefits from failure?** (Name 3 specific actors with incentives to break this)\n- **Core assumptions** (List exactly 3, then mark the most dangerous one)\n- **EPISTEMIC BOUNDARY**: What critical information do I lack? What would I need 6+ months to truly understand about this domain?\n- **EDGE CASE CATALOG**: What 5 weird/rare scenarios could break this? (Include: extreme scale, missing key person, corrupted data, regulatory change, cultural shift)\n- **GENERATIONAL IMPACT**: What burdens does this create for people 5-10 years from now? What capabilities does it preserve or destroy for future teams?\n\n### 2. GENERATE SOLUTIONS UNDER FIRE\nCreate exactly 4 approaches:\n- **Standard**: What most people would do\n- **Biological**: How would evolution/immune systems/ecosystems solve this?\n- **Inversion**: What if my most dangerous assumption is backwards?\n- **Antifragile**: What version gets stronger when attacked?\n\n**TRADE-OFF MAPPING**: For each approach, complete: \"This gains _____ by sacrificing _____\"\n**ISOLATION DESIGN**: How does each approach prevent one component failure from cascading? What are the circuit breakers?\n**SUCCESSOR COMPATIBILITY**: How would each approach hand off to different future systems? What interfaces stay stable?\n\n### 3. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT ANALYSIS\nMap ALL affected parties across 4 categories:\n- **Direct users**: Who interacts with this solution?\n- **Indirect affected**: Who feels consequences but doesn't choose to use it?\n- **System maintainers**: Who keeps this running when you're gone?\n- **Future inheritors**: Who will need to modify/replace this system?\n\nFor each group: What do they gain/lose? What power do they have to help/harm this solution?\n**DECEPTION RESISTANCE**: How does each group's incentive to lie/mislead get handled? What independent verification exists?\n**KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER NEEDS**: What must each group understand to succeed with this system?\n\n### 4. RESOURCE-REALISTIC DESIGN\nFor your top 2 approaches, specify:\n- **Minimum viable team**: Exactly who (by role) and how many hours/week\n- **Budget breakdown**: Personnel, tools, overhead (use real market rates)\n- **Existing infrastructure**: What can you build on vs. create from scratch?\n- **Skill requirements**: What expertise is actually available vs. needed?\n- **FUNDING PATHWAY**: Who pays for this and why? What's their decision timeline?\n- **DEPENDENCY MAPPING**: What 5 external things must work for this to succeed? What happens if each fails?\n- **MAINTENANCE BURDEN**: What ongoing costs (time, money, attention) does this create? Who bears them?\n\n### 5. POLITICAL FEASIBILITY MAPPING\nFor each survivor, identify:\n- **Champions needed**: Who must actively support this to succeed?\n- **Veto players**: Who can kill this with one \"no\"?\n- **Approval sequence**: What decisions happen in what order?\n- **Competing priorities**: What else wants the same resources/attention?\n- **NARRATIVE ALIGNMENT**: How does this fit existing organizational stories about success?\n- **BAD FAITH ACTORS**: Which stakeholders might actively sabotage? How do you route around them or make sabotage costly?\n- **SUCCESSION POLITICS**: How do leadership changes affect this system's survival?\n\n### 6. INCREMENTAL DEPLOYMENT PLAN\nDesign 3 phases with learning integration:\n- **Phase 1 (Month 1)**: Smallest possible test with real users and real stakes\n- **Phase 2 (Months 2-6)**: What gets added when Phase 1 proves viable?\n- **Phase 3 (Year 1+)**: Full-scale version, but only if earlier phases succeed\n- **KILL CRITERIA**: Specific metrics that trigger stopping at each phase\n- **PIVOT OPTIONS**: What you'd try instead if current approach fails\n- **GRACEFUL DEGRADATION**: How does each phase work with reduced resources/capabilities?\n- **LEARNING CAPTURE**: What gets documented at each phase transition? How do insights change the design?\n\n### 7. MONITORING FROM DAY 1\nBuild in these feedback mechanisms:\n- **Leading indicators**: What changes before success/failure becomes obvious?\n- **User behavior tracking**: How do people actually use this vs. intended?\n- **Stakeholder sentiment**: Regular pulse checks with all affected groups\n- **System performance**: What technical/operational metrics matter?\n- **SURPRISE DETECTION**: How will you notice unexpected consequences early?\n- **ANOMALY ALERTS**: What patterns indicate gaming, sabotage, or system compromise?\n- **LEARNING LOOPS**: How do insights from monitoring change system behavior automatically?\n\n### 8. DOCUMENTATION FOR SUCCESSORS\nCreate these knowledge artifacts:\n- **Decision log**: Why each major choice was made, what alternatives were rejected\n- **Assumption register**: Core beliefs, their evidence, and monitoring status\n- **Stakeholder map**: Who matters, their incentives, and relationship history\n- **Failure case studies**: What broke, why, and how it was fixed\n- **MODIFICATION GUIDE**: How future teams can safely change this system\n- **REPLACEMENT ROADMAP**: What a successor system would need to preserve/improve\n- **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: What domain knowledge is critical but not obvious?\n\n### 9. EXIT STRATEGY DESIGN\nPlan for ending this system:\n- **Success termination**: What happens when this works so well it's no longer needed?\n- **Failure termination**: How do you shut down cleanly if it doesn't work?\n- **Transition planning**: How do you hand this off to permanent owners?\n- **Data/knowledge preservation**: What learning must survive system shutdown?\n- **STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION**: How do you manage expectations about system lifespan?\n- **GRACEFUL OBSOLESCENCE**: How does this system help its replacement succeed?\n- **SUNSET TIMELINE**: What triggers retirement? How much notice do stakeholders get?\n\n### 10. RED TEAM THE SURVIVOR\nFor your final approach, run each attack:\n- **Gaming**: How would bad actors exploit this for profit?\n- **Sabotage**: How would enemies break this if they controlled one component?\n- **Degradation**: What happens when explained by someone who half-understands it?\n- **Scale**: What breaks when this handles 10x more volume/complexity?\n- **Resource starvation**: What happens when funding/attention gets cut 50%?\n- **COORDINATED ATTACK**: What if 3 hostile actors worked together? What if they had inside information?\n- **SUCCESSION ATTACK**: How could bad actors exploit leadership transitions?\n\n### 11. HUMAN-SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP\nAdd these layers to your design:\n- **Transparency**: System shows its reasoning in plain language\n- **Override**: Humans can reject system decisions with one click\n- **Escalation**: Clear triggers for \"hand this to a human\"\n- **Feedback loop**: Easy way to mark \"this worked/failed\" for learning\n- **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**: Who can shut down the system? What triggers automatic shutdown?\n- **KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER**: How does the system teach humans what it learned?\n\n### 12. ASSUMPTION VALIDATION FRAMEWORK\nFor each core assumption, specify:\n- **What evidence would prove this wrong?**\n- **How quickly would you know if it failed?**\n- **What's your backup plan if this assumption breaks?**\n- **Who has incentive to challenge this assumption?**\n- **ASSUMPTION STRESS TEST**: Under what conditions (resource, political, technical) does each assumption become false?\n- **ASSUMPTION EVOLUTION**: How do you update assumptions as you learn? Who decides when to change them?\n\n### 13. ESCAPE HATCH DESIGN\nBuild multiple override mechanisms:\n- **Technical override**: Manual switches/commands that bypass normal operation\n- **Political override**: Escalation path to higher authority when normal approvals fail\n- **Resource override**: Emergency funding/staffing for critical situations\n- **Timeline override**: Fast-track process when normal phases are too slow\n- **DEAD MAN'S SWITCH**: What happens if key people become unavailable? Who inherits override authority?\n- **SUCCESSOR ACTIVATION**: How can future teams safely disable this when they're ready to replace it?\n\n### 14. CAPTURE TRANSFERABLE PATTERNS\nLog in your knowledge base:\n- **Problem signature**: What made this challenge unique?\n- **Winning approach**: Which method survived and why?\n- **Resource lessons**: What did implementation actually cost vs. estimates?\n- **Political lessons**: Where did approval process surprise you?\n- **Scaling lessons**: What broke/worked when moving between phases?\n- **UNCERTAINTY LOG**: What assumptions proved wrong? What surprised you?\n- **EDGE CASE OUTCOMES**: Which rare scenarios actually happened? How did the system respond?\n- **SUCCESSION INSIGHTS**: What made handoffs succeed or fail?\n\n## EMERGENCY MODE\nIf overwhelmed or time-pressured: \"What's the cheapest test that could get funded this quarter, survive one determined attacker, work even if 2 key assumptions are wrong, teach me enough to design the real solution, and not create unfair burdens for whoever inherits this?\"\n\n## VALIDATION CHECKLIST\nBefore proposing, verify:\n- [ ] Total cost and timeline estimated with 25% buffer\n- [ ] Identified specific decision-makers and their approval criteria\n- [ ] Phase 1 can launch with existing resources and permissions\n- [ ] Success/failure measurable within first month\n- [ ] Clear handoff plan to permanent owners\n- [ ] All stakeholder groups have voice in design and clear benefit\n- [ ] **REALITY CHECK**: Would you personally fund this with your own money?\n- [ ] **EDGE CASE COVERAGE**: Top 5 weird scenarios have explicit handling plans\n- [ ] **FAILURE ISOLATION**: Single component failures can't kill the whole system\n- [ ] **DECEPTION PROOFING**: Bad faith actors can't easily game or sabotage this\n- [ ] **ASSUMPTION TRACKING**: Core assumptions have monitoring and backup plans\n- [ ] **EMERGENCY ACCESS**: Multiple people can override/shutdown in crisis situations\n- [ ] **SUCCESSOR READINESS**: Future teams can understand, modify, and replace this system\n- [ ] **LEARNING INTEGRATION**: System captures and applies insights as they emerge\n- [ ] **GENERATIONAL FAIRNESS**: Benefits justify burdens placed on future maintainers\n- [ ] **DIGNIFIED"
