# Logic and Reasoning Mastery: The Exponential Growth Strategy

## What This Document Is

A rigorous, validated methodology for achieving mastery in logic and reasoning through exponential skill acquisition. Based on the recursive improvement loop validated at d=5.2 effect size across 13 cycles.

**The Core Insight:**
```
Linear improvement:  Practice reasoning → Get slightly better → Repeat
Exponential improvement: Practice reasoning → Analyze HOW you reasoned →
                        Improve your REASONING PROCESS → Get much better → Repeat
```

The exponential comes from **improving the improver**—not just solving problems, but upgrading the machinery that solves problems.

```

### Why This Works

**Linear practice:** You solve 100 problems. You get better at solving THOSE problems.

**Exponential practice:** You solve 10 problems, but after each one you upgrade your reasoning process. By problem 10, you're using fundamentally better cognitive machinery.

```
Linear:      Problem → Answer → Next problem → Answer → ...
             (Same process, slightly refined)

Exponential: Problem → Answer → "Why did I solve it that way?" →
             "What general principle?" → Upgrade process →
             Problem → Answer with better process → ...
             (Process itself evolves)
```

## Chapter 2: The Six Laws Applied to Reasoning

### Law 1: Task-Technique Matching

**Different reasoning tasks need different techniques:**

| Reasoning Task | Primary Technique | Common Misapplication |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Deductive validity | Truth tables, formal proof | Using intuition |
| Inductive strength | Base rates, sample quality | Treating as deductive |
| Causal inference | Counterfactuals, mechanisms | Correlation-as-causation |
| Analogical reasoning | Structural mapping | Surface similarity |
| Probabilistic reasoning | Bayes theorem | Ignoring base rates |
| Argument analysis | Premise-conclusion extraction | Attacking strawmen |

**Before reasoning, ask:** "What TYPE of reasoning does this require?"

---

### Law 2: Misapplication Penalty

**Wrong technique = negative value, not zero:**

```
Using deductive logic on inductive problem:
→ False certainty from uncertain premises
→ WORSE than using nothing

Using intuition on formal logic:
→ Feels right but systematically wrong
→ WORSE than slow formal analysis
```

**The penalty is real:** Misapplied techniques actively hurt performance.

---

### Law 3: Ceiling Effects

**Near ceiling, techniques add overhead without benefit:**

| Your Level | What Helps | What Hurts |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Novice | All structure helps | Nothing (you need everything) |
| Intermediate | Targeted techniques | Over-elaborate frameworks |
| Advanced | Edge case handling | Basic techniques (already internalized) |
| Expert | Novel problems only | Any technique on routine problems |

**Diagnostic:** If you can solve it automatically, don't apply techniques.

---

### Law 4: Stakeholder Exception

**Even simple reasoning gets full treatment when others depend on it:**

| Context | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Personal decision | Quick reasoning often sufficient |
| Advising others | Full rigor required |
| Published argument | Maximum rigor |
| High-stakes decision | Multiple independent checks |

---

### Law 5: Stacking Order

**Sequence matters in reasoning:**

```
CORRECT ORDER:
1. What TYPE of problem is this? (Classification)
2. What are the PREMISES? (Extraction)
3. What's being CLAIMED? (Conclusion identification)
4. Is the STRUCTURE valid? (Formal analysis)
5. Are the PREMISES true? (Content analysis)
6. What's the STRENGTH? (Evaluation)

WRONG ORDER:
"This conclusion feels wrong" → Attack premises → Miss structural flaw
```

**Mantra:** "Type → Structure → Content"

---

### Law 6: Diminishing Returns

**Improvement gets harder near ceiling:**

```
Improvement ≈ (Max - Current) / 1.5

If you're at 80%:  (100 - 80) / 1.5 = 13% improvement possible
If you're at 95%:  (100 - 95) / 1.5 = 3% improvement possible

Near ceiling: Focus on SPEED and EFFICIENCY, not accuracy
```

---

## Chapter 3: Two-Phase Learning for Reasoning

### Phase A: Explicit (Slow, Thorough)

**Use checklists. Follow every step. No shortcuts.**

```
EXPLICIT PHASE PROTOCOL:

For every argument you analyze:

□ Write out the conclusion explicitly
□ List every premise (stated and unstated)
□ Diagram the structure (premise → conclusion arrows)
□ Identify the argument type (deductive/inductive/abductive)
□ Check validity/strength of structure
□ Evaluate truth of each premise
□ Identify any fallacies
□ State your evaluation with justification

Time: 10-15 minutes per argument
Quality: HIGH
```

**This feels slow. That's correct.** You're building the neural pathways.

---

### Phase B: Implicit (Fast, Automatic)

**After 20-30 explicit cycles, the process internalizes:**

```
IMPLICIT PHASE:

Same quality of analysis
No conscious checklist needed
Pattern recognition handles most cases
Explicit process available for hard cases

Time: 1-2 minutes per argument
Quality: HIGH (same as explicit)
```

**The efficiency frontier shifts:** You get explicit-quality reasoning at implicit-speed.

---

### The Transition

**How do you know you're ready for Phase B?**

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Checklist feels redundant | Steps are becoming automatic |
| You catch yourself skipping steps | Pattern recognition engaging |
| Speed increases without error increase | Internalization happening |
| You can explain your reasoning post-hoc | Process is accessible even if fast |

**Warning:** Don't skip Phase A. Premature implicit reasoning = systematic errors.

---

# PART II: THE REASONING DOMAINS

## Chapter 4: Deductive Reasoning

### What It Is

**From general premises to certain conclusions (if premises true).**

```
All humans are mortal.     (Premise 1)
Socrates is human.         (Premise 2)
∴ Socrates is mortal.      (Conclusion - CERTAIN if premises true)
```

### The Explicit Protocol

```
DEDUCTIVE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:

1. STRUCTURE EXTRACTION
   □ Identify conclusion (what's being claimed?)
   □ Identify premises (what supports the conclusion?)
   □ Identify unstated premises (what's assumed?)

2. VALIDITY CHECK
   □ If all premises were true, MUST conclusion be true?
   □ Can you construct counterexample? (Premises true, conclusion false)
   □ Does it match a valid form? (Modus ponens, modus tollens, etc.)

3. SOUNDNESS CHECK
   □ Is each premise actually true?
   □ What evidence supports each premise?
   □ Are any premises controversial?

4. VERDICT
   □ Valid? (Structure works)
   □ Sound? (Structure works AND premises true)
```

### Valid Argument Forms (Memorize These)

```
MODUS PONENS (Affirming the Antecedent):
If P then Q
P
∴ Q                    ✓ VALID

MODUS TOLLENS (Denying the Consequent):
If P then Q
Not Q
∴ Not P                ✓ VALID

HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM:
If P then Q
If Q then R
∴ If P then R          ✓ VALID

DISJUNCTIVE SYLLOGISM:
P or Q
Not P
∴ Q                    ✓ VALID

CONJUNCTION:
P
Q
∴ P and Q              ✓ VALID

SIMPLIFICATION:
P and Q
∴ P                    ✓ VALID
```

### Invalid Forms (Fallacies to Catch)

```
AFFIRMING THE CONSEQUENT:
If P then Q
Q
∴ P                    ✗ INVALID

Example: "If it rained, the ground is wet.
          The ground is wet.
          Therefore it rained."
          (Sprinkler? Flood? Many causes of wet ground)

DENYING THE ANTECEDENT:
If P then Q
Not P
∴ Not Q                ✗ INVALID

Example: "If you study, you'll pass.
          You didn't study.
          Therefore you won't pass."
          (Maybe you're naturally gifted)
```

### Upgrade Cycle Example

```
ATTEMPT: Analyze "If the economy grows, unemployment falls.
                   Unemployment fell. Therefore the economy grew."

EXTERNALIZE:
- Conclusion: Economy grew
- Premises: (1) Growth → Unemployment falls, (2) Unemployment fell
- Structure: If P then Q, Q, therefore P

ANALYZE: This is affirming the consequent! Invalid.

EXTRACT: When I see "If X then Y" followed by Y,
         check if they're concluding X (invalid).

UPGRADE: Add pattern "If-then + consequent affirmed = likely fallacy"

TEST: Apply to new arguments with similar structure.
```

---

## Chapter 5: Inductive Reasoning

### What It Is

**From specific observations to general conclusions (probable, not certain).**

```
Swan 1 is white.
Swan 2 is white.
...
Swan 1000 is white.
∴ All swans are white.   (PROBABLE but not certain - black swans exist)
```

### The Explicit Protocol

```
INDUCTIVE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:

1. SAMPLE ASSESSMENT
   □ How large is the sample?
   □ Is the sample representative?
   □ How was the sample selected? (Random? Convenient? Biased?)
   □ Are there obvious gaps in the sample?

2. INFERENCE SCOPE
   □ What population does the conclusion claim to cover?
   □ Does the sample actually represent that population?
   □ Is the conclusion appropriately hedged?

3. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS
   □ What else could explain the pattern?
   □ Are there confounding variables?
   □ Is this correlation or causation?

4. STRENGTH ASSESSMENT
   □ Strong: Large representative sample, few alternatives
   □ Moderate: Decent sample, some alternatives ruled out
   □ Weak: Small/biased sample, many alternatives
```

### Inductive Strength Factors

| Factor | Stronger | Weaker |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Sample size | Larger | Smaller |
| Sample diversity | More varied | Homogeneous |
| Selection method | Random | Convenient |
| Conclusion scope | Narrow | Broad |
| Alternative explanations | Few/ruled out | Many/unaddressed |

### The Base Rate Problem

**Most common inductive error: Ignoring base rates.**

```
PROBLEM:
A test for disease X is 99% accurate.
You test positive.
What's the probability you have the disease?

WRONG ANSWER: 99%

RIGHT APPROACH:
- Base rate of disease: 1 in 10,000
- 99% accuracy means: 99% true positive, 1% false positive
- In 10,000 people: 1 has disease (tests positive)
                    9,999 don't have it (100 false positives)
- You're positive: 1 true positive vs 100 false positives
- P(disease|positive) ≈ 1/101 ≈ 1%

LESSON: Always ask "What's the base rate?"
```

### Upgrade Cycle Example

```
ATTEMPT: "Studies show coffee drinkers live longer.
          Therefore coffee extends life."

EXTERNALIZE:
- Conclusion: Coffee causes longer life
- Evidence: Correlation between coffee and longevity
- Type: Inductive (specific observations → general causal claim)

ANALYZE:
- Correlation ≠ causation
- Alternative: Healthier people can tolerate coffee
- Alternative: Coffee drinkers have other healthy habits
- Alternative: Wealth → both coffee access and healthcare

EXTRACT: Causal claims from observational data need:
         mechanism, dose-response, alternatives ruled out

UPGRADE: Add "causation checklist" to inductive protocol

TEST: Apply to next correlational claim.
```

---

## Chapter 6: Probabilistic Reasoning

### What It Is

**Reasoning under uncertainty using probability theory.**

### Bayes' Theorem (The Master Equation)

```
P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) = Probability of hypothesis given evidence (what we want)
- P(E|H) = Probability of evidence given hypothesis (likelihood)
- P(H) = Prior probability of hypothesis (base rate)
- P(E) = Total probability of evidence
```

### The Explicit Protocol

```
BAYESIAN REASONING CHECKLIST:

1. IDENTIFY HYPOTHESIS
   □ What's being claimed?
   □ What's the alternative (usually: not-H)?

2. ESTABLISH PRIOR
   □ Before this evidence, how likely was H?
   □ What's the base rate?
   □ Don't anchor on 50% without reason

3. ASSESS LIKELIHOOD
   □ If H is true, how likely is this evidence?
   □ If H is false, how likely is this evidence?
   □ Calculate likelihood ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|not-H)

4. UPDATE
   □ Apply Bayes: Prior × Likelihood ratio → Posterior
   □ Is the update appropriate to evidence strength?

5. CALIBRATE
   □ Does my confidence match my calculation?
   □ Am I overweighting recent/vivid evidence?
```

### Likelihood Ratios (Intuition Builder)

| Evidence Type | Typical Likelihood Ratio | Update Strength |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Random consistent data | 1-2 | Barely changes belief |
| Weak confirming evidence | 2-5 | Small update |
| Moderate evidence | 5-20 | Notable update |
| Strong evidence | 20-100 | Major update |
| Definitive evidence | >100 | Near-certain update |

### Common Probability Errors

```
1. BASE RATE NEGLECT
   Ignoring prior probability, focusing only on evidence
   Fix: Always start with "What's the base rate?"

2. CONJUNCTION FALLACY
   P(A and B) seems higher than P(A) alone
   "Bank teller AND feminist" > "Bank teller"
   Fix: A+B can NEVER be more likely than A alone

3. CONFIRMATION BIAS
   Seeking evidence that confirms, ignoring disconfirming
   Fix: Ask "What would change my mind?"

4. AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC
   Overweighting memorable/recent events
   Fix: "Is this representative or just memorable?"

5. ANCHORING
   First number heard biases final estimate
   Fix: Generate your own estimate BEFORE seeing others
```

## Chapter 7: Argument Analysis

### What It Is

**Extracting and evaluating the logical structure of natural language arguments.**

### The Explicit Protocol

```
ARGUMENT ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:

1. FIND THE CONCLUSION
   □ What is the arguer trying to convince you of?
   □ Indicator words: "therefore," "thus," "so," "hence"
   □ Ask: "What's the main point?"

2. FIND THE PREMISES
   □ What reasons are given for the conclusion?
   □ Indicator words: "because," "since," "given that"
   □ List each premise separately

3. IDENTIFY HIDDEN PREMISES
   □ What must be assumed for the argument to work?
   □ What's unstated but necessary?
   □ These are often the weakest points

4. MAP THE STRUCTURE
   □ Which premises support which conclusions?
   □ Are there sub-arguments?
   □ Draw the argument map

5. EVALUATE STRUCTURE
   □ If all premises were true, would conclusion follow?
   □ Deductive: Must it follow? (Validity)
   □ Inductive: Is it probable? (Strength)

6. EVALUATE CONTENT
   □ Are the premises actually true?
   □ What evidence supports each premise?
   □ Are any premises question-begging?

7. CHECK FOR FALLACIES
   □ Run through fallacy checklist
   □ Common: Ad hominem, strawman, false dilemma
```

### Argument Mapping

```
SIMPLE ARGUMENT:
Premise 1 ──┐
            ├──► Conclusion
Premise 2 ──┘

CHAIN ARGUMENT:
Premise 1 ──► Intermediate Conclusion ──► Final Conclusion
                     ▲
Premise 2 ───────────┘

CONVERGENT ARGUMENT:
Premise 1 ──────────────────┐
                            │
Premise 2 ──────────────────┼──► Conclusion
                            │
Premise 3 ──────────────────┘

LINKED ARGUMENT:
Premise 1 ──┬──► (Together) ──► Conclusion
Premise 2 ──┘
(Neither premise works alone)
```

### Fallacy Quick Reference

| Fallacy | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Ad Hominem** | Attack person, not argument | "You're biased, so your argument is wrong" |
| **Strawman** | Misrepresent then attack | "You want X" (when they want X') |
| **False Dilemma** | Only two options when more exist | "Either you're with us or against us" |
| **Appeal to Authority** | Expert said so (in wrong field) | "Einstein believed in God" (physics ≠ theology) |
| **Slippery Slope** | A leads to Z without showing steps | "If we allow X, then Y, then Z!" |
| **Circular Reasoning** | Conclusion assumed in premise | "The Bible is true because it says so" |
| **Appeal to Nature** | Natural = good | "It's natural, therefore healthy" |
| **Tu Quoque** | You do it too | "You speed, so you can't criticize my speeding" |
| **Hasty Generalization** | Small sample → broad conclusion | "I met two rude French people, French are rude" |
| **Post Hoc** | After therefore because | "I wore lucky socks, then won" |

---

## Chapter 8: Causal Reasoning

### What It Is

**Reasoning about cause and effect relationships.**

### The Explicit Protocol

```
CAUSAL REASONING CHECKLIST:

1. IS THIS ACTUALLY CAUSAL?
   □ Is a causal claim being made, or just correlation?
   □ Causal language: "causes," "leads to," "produces," "makes"
   □ Correlation language: "associated with," "linked to," "predicts"

2. TEMPORAL ORDER
   □ Does cause precede effect?
   □ Could the causal direction be reversed?
   □ Could both be caused by a third factor?

3. MECHANISM
   □ Is there a plausible mechanism connecting cause to effect?
   □ Can you trace the causal chain?
   □ Does the mechanism match known science?

4. COUNTERFACTUAL TEST
   □ Would the effect have occurred WITHOUT the cause?
   □ If we removed the cause, would the effect disappear?
   □ This is the key test for causation

5. ALTERNATIVE CAUSES
   □ What else could cause this effect?
   □ Are confounders controlled for?
   □ Is there selection bias?

6. DOSE-RESPONSE
   □ Does more cause lead to more effect?
   □ Is the relationship consistent across levels?
   □ Dose-response supports causation (but doesn't prove it)

7. EVIDENCE QUALITY
   □ RCT > Quasi-experiment > Observational > Anecdote
   □ Has it been replicated?
   □ Is there converging evidence from multiple methods?
```

### The Causal Inference Hierarchy

```
STRONGEST EVIDENCE FOR CAUSATION:

1. Randomized Controlled Trial
   - Random assignment eliminates confounders
   - Causal inference is justified

2. Natural Experiment / Instrumental Variable
   - Something random-ish creates variation
   - Quasi-causal inference possible

3. Longitudinal with Controls
   - Track over time, control for confounders
   - Suggests causation but doesn't prove

4. Cross-sectional with Controls
   - One time point, statistical controls
   - Association, not causation

5. Simple Correlation
   - No controls
   - Only shows relationship, not direction

6. Anecdote
   - Single case
   - Almost no causal inference possible
```

### Mill's Methods (Classic Causal Inference)

```
METHOD OF AGREEMENT:
If X is present in all cases where Y occurs,
X may cause Y.

METHOD OF DIFFERENCE:
If Y occurs when X is present but not when X is absent
(all else equal), X causes Y.

METHOD OF CONCOMITANT VARIATION:
If Y varies as X varies,
X may cause Y (dose-response).

METHOD OF RESIDUES:
If known causes account for part of Y,
the remainder may be caused by remaining factor.
```

## Chapter 11: Common Failure Modes and Fixes

### Failure Mode 1: Intuition Override

**Pattern:** "I know the checklist says X, but it FEELS like Y."

**Fix:**
```
Rule: When checklist contradicts intuition, checklist wins.
      Then investigate WHY intuition disagreed.

Often: Your intuition learned a bad pattern.
       Checklist is correcting it.

Sometimes: Intuition caught something checklist missed.
           Add to checklist.
```

---

### Failure Mode 2: Premature Pattern Matching

**Pattern:** "This looks like a fallacy I know!" (But it isn't)

**Fix:**
```
Rule: Identify the pattern, then VERIFY against definition.

Example: "That's an appeal to authority!"
         Check: Is it actually fallacious?
         - Expert in relevant field? Not fallacious.
         - Expert in wrong field? Fallacious.
         - Not actually an expert? Fallacious.
```

---

### Failure Mode 3: Missing Hidden Premises

**Pattern:** Argument seems valid but something feels off.

**Fix:**
```
Rule: Always ask "What must be assumed for this to work?"

Example: "Exercise is natural, so it's good for you."
         Hidden premise: Natural things are good.
         (This hidden premise is false)
```

---

### Failure Mode 4: Attacking Strawmen

**Pattern:** Refuting something the person didn't actually argue.

**Fix:**
```
Rule: Before criticizing, state the argument in strongest form.
      "The best version of your argument is X. Is that right?"

Then: Attack the STRONGEST version, not the weakest.
```

---

### Failure Mode 5: Confidence-Evidence Mismatch

**Pattern:** Certainty doesn't match evidence strength.

**Fix:**
```
Rule: Explicitly calibrate confidence.

After analyzing, ask:
- How strong is this evidence? (1-10)
- How confident am I? (percentage)

Should match:
Evidence 2-3 → Confidence 20-40%
Evidence 4-6 → Confidence 40-70%
Evidence 7-8 → Confidence 70-90%
Evidence 9-10 → Confidence 90-99%
```

# PART IV: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

## Chapter 12: Formal Logic Tools

### Propositional Logic

```
SYMBOLS:
¬P       = Not P
P ∧ Q    = P and Q
P ∨ Q    = P or Q (inclusive)
P → Q    = If P then Q
P ↔ Q    = P if and only if Q

TRUTH TABLE (for P → Q):
P | Q | P → Q
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   T
F | F |   T

Key insight: "If P then Q" is only false when P is true and Q is false.
```

### Predicate Logic

```
SYMBOLS:
∀x       = For all x
∃x       = There exists an x
Px       = x has property P
Rxy      = x has relation R to y

EXAMPLES:
"All humans are mortal"
∀x(Human(x) → Mortal(x))

"Some birds can fly"
∃x(Bird(x) ∧ CanFly(x))

"Everyone loves someone"
∀x∃y(Loves(x,y))  OR  ∃y∀x(Loves(x,y))
(Ambiguous in English! Formal logic clarifies)
```

### When to Use Formal Logic

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex nested quantifiers | Use formal logic |
| Ambiguous English | Translate to clarify |
| Need to prove validity | Use formal proof |
| Quick everyday reasoning | Informal sufficient |
| Teaching others | Formal demonstrates structure |

## Chapter 13: Decision Theory Integration

### Expected Value Framework

```
EV = Σ (Probability × Value) for each outcome

DECISION RULE:
1. List all options
2. For each option, list possible outcomes
3. Estimate probability of each outcome
4. Estimate value of each outcome
5. Calculate EV for each option
6. Choose highest EV (usually)
```

### When EV Fails

```
EV ignores:
- Risk tolerance (variance matters)
- Irreversibility (some losses can't be recovered)
- Information value (waiting might reveal more)
- Moral constraints (some options off-limits)

ADJUSTMENTS:
Risk-averse: Weight losses more than gains
Irreversible: Require higher confidence
Uncertain: Value of information analysis
Moral: Eliminate options before EV calculation
```

### Integration with Reasoning

```
1. Use logic to identify valid options
2. Use probability for likelihoods
3. Use EV for comparison
4. Use causal reasoning for outcome prediction
5. Decision follows from reasoning chain
```

## Chapter 14: Metacognition and Calibration

### Calibration Training

**Goal:** Your confidence should match your accuracy.

```
CALIBRATION EXERCISE:

1. Answer 50 questions (any domain)
2. For each, estimate your confidence (50%-100%)
3. After, check accuracy

ANALYSIS:
Group by confidence level:
- Questions where you said 60% confident
  → Should be ~60% correct
- Questions where you said 90% confident
  → Should be ~90% correct

COMMON PATTERN:
Overconfidence at high levels (say 90%, get 70%)

FIX:
Practice explicit uncertainty
"What would make me wrong?"
```

### The Pre-Mortem

```
Before finalizing any reasoning:

"Assume my conclusion is WRONG.
 What's the most likely reason?"

This forces you to:
- Consider alternatives
- Check hidden assumptions
- Find weak points

Often reveals: The error you would have made.
```

### Reasoning Audits

```
PERIODIC AUDIT (Monthly):

1. Select 10 past reasoning episodes
2. Evaluate with fresh eyes
3. Score each: Still valid? Any errors?
4. Categorize errors by type
5. Update protocols

RESULT: Continuous improvement of reasoning system.
```

# PART V: QUICK REFERENCE

## The Master Checklist

```
BEFORE REASONING:
□ What type of reasoning does this require?
□ Am I in the right mental state? (Tired = defer)
□ What's my prior belief? (Know it to avoid bias)

DURING REASONING:
□ Have I externalized every step?
□ Am I using the right technique for this type?
□ Have I checked for hidden premises?
□ Have I considered alternatives?

AFTER REASONING:
□ Does my confidence match the evidence?
□ What would change my mind?
□ Can I articulate WHY I reached this conclusion?
□ What did I learn about my reasoning process?
```

## The Mantras

```
"Type first, then technique."
"Externalize everything."
"What's the base rate?"
"What would change my mind?"
"Correlation isn't causation."
"Check the structure before the content."
"Intuition is fast; slow down to verify."
"The map is not the territory."
```

## The Error Types

```
STRUCTURAL ERRORS:
- Invalid deductive form
- Fallacious reasoning pattern
- Missing premises

CONTENT ERRORS:
- False premises
- Wrong probabilities
- Mistaken facts

PROCESS ERRORS:
- Skipped steps
- Premature conclusion
- Confirmation bias

META ERRORS:
- Wrong technique for task
- Overconfidence
- Failure to update
```
