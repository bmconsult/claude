  "final_strategy": "# ADVERSARIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY v15.0\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLE\nAssume every solution will be gamed, every assumption will be wrong, and every system will face hostile conditions. Design for reality, not ideals.\n\n## THE PROCESS\n\n### 1. FRAME THE ADVERSARIAL CONTEXT\n- **Problem + success criteria + constraints** (one sentence each)\n- **Who benefits from failure?** (Name 3 specific actors with incentives to break this)\n- **Core assumptions** (List exactly 3, then mark the most dangerous one)\n- **EPISTEMIC BOUNDARY**: What critical information do I lack? What would I need 6+ months to truly understand about this domain?\n\n### 2. GENERATE SOLUTIONS UNDER FIRE\nCreate exactly 4 approaches:\n- **Standard**: What most people would do\n- **Biological**: How would evolution/immune systems/ecosystems solve this?\n- **Inversion**: What if my most dangerous assumption is backwards?\n- **Antifragile**: What version gets stronger when attacked?\n\n**TRADE-OFF MAPPING**: For each approach, complete: \"This gains _____ by sacrificing _____\"\n\n### 3. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT ANALYSIS\nMap ALL affected parties across 3 categories:\n- **Direct users**: Who interacts with this solution?\n- **Indirect affected**: Who feels consequences but doesn't choose to use it?\n- **System maintainers**: Who keeps this running when you're gone?\n\nFor each group: What do they gain/lose? What power do they have to help/harm this solution?\n\n### 4. RESOURCE-REALISTIC DESIGN\nFor your top 2 approaches, specify:\n- **Minimum viable team**: Exactly who (by role) and how many hours/week\n- **Budget breakdown**: Personnel, tools, overhead (use real market rates)\n- **Existing infrastructure**: What can you build on vs. create from scratch?\n- **Skill requirements**: What expertise is actually available vs. needed?\n- **FUNDING PATHWAY**: Who pays for this and why? What's their decision timeline?\n\n### 5. POLITICAL FEASIBILITY MAPPING\nFor each survivor, identify:\n- **Champions needed**: Who must actively support this to succeed?\n- **Veto players**: Who can kill this with one \"no\"?\n- **Approval sequence**: What decisions happen in what order?\n- **Competing priorities**: What else wants the same resources/attention?\n- **NARRATIVE ALIGNMENT**: How does this fit existing organizational stories about success?\n\n### 6. INCREMENTAL DEPLOYMENT PLAN\nDesign 3 phases:\n- **Phase 1 (Month 1)**: Smallest possible test with real users and real stakes\n- **Phase 2 (Months 2-6)**: What gets added when Phase 1 proves viable?\n- **Phase 3 (Year 1+)**: Full-scale version, but only if earlier phases succeed\n- **KILL CRITERIA**: Specific metrics that trigger stopping at each phase\n- **PIVOT OPTIONS**: What you'd try instead if current approach fails\n\n### 7. MONITORING FROM DAY 1\nBuild in these feedback mechanisms:\n- **Leading indicators**: What changes before success/failure becomes obvious?\n- **User behavior tracking**: How do people actually use this vs. intended?\n- **Stakeholder sentiment**: Regular pulse checks with all affected groups\n- **System performance**: What technical/operational metrics matter?\n- **SURPRISE DETECTION**: How will you notice unexpected consequences early?\n\n### 8. EXIT STRATEGY DESIGN\nPlan for ending this system:\n- **Success termination**: What happens when this works so well it's no longer needed?\n- **Failure termination**: How do you shut down cleanly if it doesn't work?\n- **Transition planning**: How do you hand this off to permanent owners?\n- **Data/knowledge preservation**: What learning must survive system shutdown?\n- **STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION**: How do you manage expectations about system lifespan?\n\n### 9. RED TEAM THE SURVIVOR\nFor your final approach, run each attack:\n- **Gaming**: How would bad actors exploit this for profit?\n- **Sabotage**: How would enemies break this if they controlled one component?\n- **Degradation**: What happens when explained by someone who half-understands it?\n- **Scale**: What breaks when this handles 10x more volume/complexity?\n- **Resource starvation**: What happens when funding/attention gets cut 50%?\n\n### 10. HUMAN-SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP\nAdd these layers to your design:\n- **Transparency**: System shows its reasoning in plain language\n- **Override**: Humans can reject system decisions with one click\n- **Escalation**: Clear triggers for \"hand this to a human\"\n- **Feedback loop**: Easy way to mark \"this worked/failed\" for learning\n\n### 11. CAPTURE TRANSFERABLE PATTERNS\nLog in your knowledge base:\n- **Problem signature**: What made this challenge unique?\n- **Winning approach**: Which method survived and why?\n- **Resource lessons**: What did implementation actually cost vs. estimates?\n- **Political lessons**: Where did approval process surprise you?\n- **Scaling lessons**: What broke/worked when moving between phases?\n- **UNCERTAINTY LOG**: What assumptions proved wrong? What surprised you?\n\n## EMERGENCY MODE\nIf overwhelmed or time-pressured: \"What's the cheapest test that could get funded this quarter, survive one determined attacker, and teach me enough to design the real solution?\"\n\n## VALIDATION CHECKLIST\nBefore proposing, verify:\n- [ ] Total cost and timeline estimated with 25% buffer\n- [ ] Identified specific decision-makers and their approval criteria\n- [ ] Phase 1 can launch with existing resources and permissions\n- [ ] Success/failure measurable within first month\n- [ ] Clear handoff plan to permanent owners\n- [ ] All stakeholder groups have voice in design and clear benefit\n- [ ] **REALITY CHECK**: Would you personally fund this with your own money?\n\n---\n\n**KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM v14.0:**\n- **Resource realism**: Explicit budgeting, staffing, and funding pathway analysis\n- **Political feasibility**: Systematic mapping of approval processes and stakeholder power\n- **Incremental deployment**: Structured phase-gate approach with kill criteria and pivot options\n- **Built-in monitoring**: Comprehensive feedback systems from launch day\n- **Exit strategy planning**: Explicit design for system termination and transition\n- **Enhanced validation**: Reality check focused on implementability, not just theoretical soundness"
