# Cycle 4 EXTREME: Blind Problem Solutions

*Problems generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 - I have NOT seen these before*

## Problem 1: The Quantum Archive Paradox

**Problem**: 1000 documents. Three AIs (95% accuracy each) classify a document. AI1 and AI2 say "authentic", AI3 says "generated". BUT: whenever exactly 2/3 AIs agree, the document is replaced with opposite type BEFORE observation. What's P(originally authentic)?

### My Solution

**Step 1: Understand the twist**

The replacement happens when exactly 2/3 agree. In our case, 2 say authentic, 1 says generated - so 2/3 agree on "authentic." This triggers replacement.

Wait - but the problem says "before you observe the results (though you don't know if it happened for your specific document)."

So replacement MIGHT have happened. Let me think more carefully.

**Step 2: What triggers replacement?**

"Whenever exactly 2 out of 3 AIs agree on any document, that document is automatically re-classified and replaced"

Our case: 2 say authentic, 1 says generated. That's exactly 2/3 agreeing. So replacement WAS triggered.

But wait - if the document was replaced, then what we're seeing is the AI classifications of the REPLACEMENT document, not the original.

**Step 3: The retrocausal twist**

The problem asks for P(originally authentic) given the test results. But the test results are ON the potentially-replaced document.

Let me define:
- O = original type (A = authentic, G = generated)
- R = whether replacement occurred
- T = test results (we observe: 2A, 1G)

The replacement rule: If exactly 2/3 agree → replace with opposite type.

**Step 4: Work through the cases**

Case 1: Original was Authentic (O=A)
- For 3 AIs testing an authentic doc:
  - P(correct) = 0.95, P(wrong) = 0.05
  - P(all 3 say A) = 0.95³ = 0.857
  - P(exactly 2 say A) = 3 × 0.95² × 0.05 = 0.135
  - P(exactly 1 says A) = 3 × 0.95 × 0.05² = 0.007
  - P(all say G) = 0.05³ = 0.000125

When exactly 2/3 agree, replacement happens:
- 2A, 1G (2 agree on A): triggers replacement → becomes G
- 1A, 2G (2 agree on G): triggers replacement → becomes A

Case 2: Original was Generated (O=G)
- P(all 3 say G) = 0.95³ = 0.857
- P(exactly 2 say G) = 0.135
- P(exactly 1 says G) = 0.007
- P(all say A) = 0.000125

**Step 5: The observation**

We see 2A, 1G. But the document we're testing might be:
1. The original (if no replacement)
2. A replacement (if replacement occurred)

When does 2A,1G occur WITHOUT replacement?
- Only when all 3 agree (no replacement) - but 2A,1G isn't "all agree"
- So if we see 2A,1G, replacement MUST have happened!

Wait, no. Let me re-read: replacement happens when 2/3 agree. 2A,1G means 2 agree on A. So yes, replacement triggered.

**Step 6: But what are we testing?**

If replacement happened, the document changed type. Then the AIs tested the NEW document.

So the sequence is:
1. Original document exists
2. AIs classify it
3. If 2/3 agree, replace document with opposite type
4. We observe the AI results

Hmm, but if replacement happens AFTER classification, we see the classifications of the ORIGINAL, but the document is now different.

Let me re-read: "that document is automatically re-classified and replaced"

RE-classified suggests new classifications happen. So:
1. Original document
2. First classification (we don't see this)
3. If 2/3 agree, replace and RE-classify
4. We see the re-classification

**Step 7: Reframe**

Let me assume: we see the classifications AFTER any replacement. The document we're looking at has been through the process.

If original was A:
- If first round was 3A: no replacement (3 agree, not 2), test authentic doc
- If first round was 2A,1G: replacement to G, test generated doc
- If first round was 1A,2G: replacement to A, test authentic doc
- If first round was 3G: no replacement, test authentic doc (but incorrectly, doc is still A)

Wait, 3G on an authentic doc means all 3 wrong. No replacement (3 agree), doc stays A, but they said G.

This is getting complex. Let me simplify by computing P(we see 2A,1G | original was A) and P(we see 2A,1G | original was G).

**Step 8: Compute likelihoods**

P(see 2A,1G | original A):
- Path 1: First round 3A (no replace), second round 2A,1G on A doc
  - P(first 3A) × P(second 2A,1G | A) = 0.857 × 0.135 = 0.116
- Path 2: First round 2A,1G (replace to G), second round 2A,1G on G doc
  - P(first 2A,1G | A) × P(second 2A,1G | G) = 0.135 × 0.007 = 0.000945
- Path 3: First round 1A,2G (replace to A), second round 2A,1G on A doc
  - P(first 1A,2G | A) × P(second 2A,1G | A) = 0.007 × 0.135 = 0.000945
- Path 4: First round 3G (no replace), second round 2A,1G on A doc
  - P(first 3G | A) × P(second 2A,1G | A) = 0.000125 × 0.135 = 0.0000169

Total P(see 2A,1G | original A) ≈ 0.116 + 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.00002 ≈ 0.118

P(see 2A,1G | original G):
- Path 1: First round 3G (no replace), second round 2A,1G on G doc
  - 0.857 × 0.007 = 0.006
- Path 2: First round 2G,1A (replace to A), second round 2A,1G on A doc
  - 0.135 × 0.135 = 0.0182
- Path 3: First round 1G,2A (replace to G), second round 2A,1G on G doc
  - 0.007 × 0.007 = 0.000049
- Path 4: First round 3A (no replace), second round 2A,1G on G doc
  - 0.000125 × 0.007 = 0.000000875

Total P(see 2A,1G | original G) ≈ 0.006 + 0.018 + 0.00005 + 0 ≈ 0.024

**Step 9: Apply Bayes**

Assume prior P(original A) = P(original G) = 0.5 (not specified, assume symmetric)

P(original A | see 2A,1G) = P(see 2A,1G | A) × P(A) / P(see 2A,1G)

P(see 2A,1G) = 0.118 × 0.5 + 0.024 × 0.5 = 0.071

P(original A | see 2A,1G) = (0.118 × 0.5) / 0.071 = 0.059 / 0.071 ≈ **0.83**

**Verification**: Does this make sense? We see 2 AIs saying authentic. Even with the replacement mechanism, it's more likely original was authentic. The replacement mechanism reduces our confidence (from ~97% without it to ~83%), which makes sense.

**Answer: P(originally authentic) ≈ 0.83 or 83%**

## Problem 2: The Institute Hierarchy Puzzle

**7 researchers: A, B, C, D, E, F, G**
**3 levels: Junior, Senior, Director**

Constraints:
1. Each level ≥1 person, no level >4
2. A never meets anyone exactly 2 levels away
3. B meets exactly 4 others
4. C and D same level; together meet all 7
5. E meets more people than F; F higher level than E
6. If G is Director → exactly 2 Seniors; if G not Director → ≥3 Seniors
7. No Junior meets any Junior
8. Directors meet all Directors + all Seniors + some Juniors
9. A meets exactly 3 people

### My Solution

**Step 1: Deduce A's level from constraints 2 and 9**

A never meets anyone 2 levels away. The levels are J(1), S(2), D(3).
- If A is Junior (1): can't meet Directors (3) - difference of 2
- If A is Senior (2): can meet both J and D (differences of 1)
- If A is Director (3): can't meet Juniors (1) - difference of 2

A meets exactly 3 people.

If A is Junior: A can only meet Seniors. A meets 3 Seniors.
If A is Director: A can only meet Seniors (and other Directors). A meets 3 others at Senior or Director level.

**Step 2: Analyze C and D**

C and D are at same level. Together they meet all 7 (including themselves).

If C and D are Juniors: By constraint 7, Juniors don't meet Juniors. So C doesn't meet D. Together they meet all 7, but each only meets non-Juniors. Since they're both Juniors, they can only meet Seniors and Directors. For them to cover all 7, the Seniors+Directors must include all 7... but C and D are Juniors, contradiction.

So C and D are NOT Juniors.

If C and D are Directors: They meet all Directors (each other), all Seniors, and some Juniors. Together covering all 7 is possible.

If C and D are Seniors: They meet Directors (all) and can meet Juniors. Seniors meeting Seniors? Not restricted. So possible.

**Step 3: Case analysis on G**

Case G is Director: Exactly 2 Seniors
Case G is not Director: At least 3 Seniors

**Step 4: Try G is Director (exactly 2 Seniors)**

Distribution: Directors include G, Seniors = 2, rest are Juniors.
Total = 7, so Directors + 2 + Juniors = 7.

From constraint 8: Directors meet all Directors and all Seniors.

If C,D are Directors: They meet each other, G (if Director), and the 2 Seniors. That's at least 4 people each. Together that's 4+4 = 8 meetings (with overlap). They need to cover all 7. Directors meet all Directors and Seniors by rule 8. The 2 Seniors are met. The Juniors? Directors meet "some Juniors."

Let's say we have Directors: C, D, G (3)
Seniors: 2 people from {A, B, E, F}
Juniors: 2 people from {A, B, E, F}

A meets exactly 3. If A is Senior, A meets all Directors (C,D,G = 3). ✓
If A is Junior, A can only meet Seniors (by constraint 2), and there are only 2 Seniors. A would meet at most 2. But A meets 3. ✗

So A is Senior.

Seniors: A + one of {B, E, F}
Juniors: two of {B, E, F}

Constraint 5: E meets more people than F, but F is higher level than E.
If F is Senior and E is Junior: F higher ✓. E (Junior) meets only Seniors = 2 max. F (Senior) meets Directors + Seniors = 3 + 1 = 4. F meets more than E. But we need E > F in meetings. ✗

So F Senior, E Junior doesn't work.

If F is Director and E is Senior: But we assumed C, D, G are Directors. F would be 4th Director. Then there'd be 4 Directors, 2 Seniors, 1 Junior = 7. Let's check.

Directors: C, D, G, F (4)
Seniors: A, and one of {B, E} - say A, B
Juniors: E

But constraint 5 says F > E in level, E > F in meetings.
F is Director: meets all Directors (4), all Seniors (2), some Juniors = at least 6
E is Senior: meets all Directors (4), other Seniors (1), Juniors...
Actually Seniors can meet Juniors. E (Senior) meets: 4 Directors + A + some Juniors = at least 5.

Hmm, F has at least 6 meetings, E has at least 5. F > E. But constraint says E > F. ✗

Let me try: F is Senior, E is Junior doesn't work. F is Director, E is Senior doesn't work.

What if G is NOT Director?

**Step 5: Try G is NOT Director (≥3 Seniors)**

If G is Junior or Senior, there are at least 3 Seniors.

Case: G is Senior
Then we have ≥3 Seniors including G.

Let's try: Seniors = {A, G, X} for some X, with at least 3 total.

Constraint 5: F > E in level, E > F in meetings.
Options: F is Director and E is Senior, or F is Senior and E is Junior.

Try F is Senior, E is Junior:
E (Junior) meets only Seniors (can't meet Juniors by 7, can't meet Directors by 2 if E is Junior... wait, constraint 2 is about A only).

Actually constraint 2 only applies to A. Let me re-check.

Constraint 2: A never meets anyone exactly 2 levels away.
Constraint 7: No Junior meets any Junior.

So Juniors CAN meet Directors (unless they're A).

E is Junior. E can meet Seniors and Directors.
F is Senior. F meets Directors and other Seniors.

If there are 3 Seniors and, say, 2 Directors and 2 Juniors:
F (Senior) meets: 2 Directors + 2 other Seniors = 4
E (Junior) meets: 3 Seniors + 2 Directors = 5

E > F ✓ and F higher level than E ✓

**Step 6: Build a consistent assignment**

Let's try:
- Directors: C, D (2)
- Seniors: A, F, G (3)
- Juniors: B, E (2)

Check constraints:
1. Each level ≥1, ≤4: 2, 3, 2 ✓
2. A (Senior) never meets 2 levels away: Seniors are level 2, so 2 levels away is... nothing (J=1, D=3, diff of 1 each). A is fine. ✓
3. B meets exactly 4: B is Junior. B can meet Seniors and Directors. That's 3+2 = 5 max. B meets 4. ✓ (doesn't meet one of them)
4. C and D same level (both Directors) ✓. Together meet all 7? Directors meet all Directors (each other), all Seniors (A,F,G), some Juniors. They need to cover B and E (Juniors). Yes, Directors can meet Juniors. ✓
5. E meets more than F, F higher than E: F is Senior, E is Junior ✓. E (Junior) meets S+D = 3+2 = 5 max. F (Senior) meets D + other S = 2 + 2 = 4. E > F needs E ≥5, F ≤4. ✓
6. G not Director, so ≥3 Seniors: we have 3 ✓
7. No Junior meets Junior: B and E don't meet ✓
8. Directors meet all D + all S + some J: C and D meet each other, A, F, G, and some of B,E ✓
9. A meets exactly 3: A is Senior. A meets Directors (2) + other Seniors (2) = 4. That's 4, not 3. ✗

Problem: A meets 4, not 3.

**Step 7: Adjust**

Maybe A is a Junior? Let's check if possible.

If A is Junior:
- Constraint 2: A can't meet anyone 2 levels away. Junior is level 1, Director is level 3. So A can't meet Directors.
- A meets exactly 3. A can only meet Seniors. So there are at least 3 Seniors.

This forces ≥3 Seniors, which means G is not Director.

Try:
- Directors: C, D
- Seniors: F, G, and one more, say B?
- Juniors: A, E

Check A: Junior, meets only Seniors (3), not Directors. Meets F, G, B = 3. ✓

Check constraint 5: E > F meetings, F > E level.
E is Junior, F is Senior ✓
E can meet Seniors (3) + Directors (2) = 5
F (Senior) meets Directors (2) + other Seniors (2) = 4
E > F ✓

Check B: B meets exactly 4. B is Senior. B meets Directors (2) + other Seniors (2) + some Juniors.
That's already 4 from just D's and S's. So B meets no Juniors (or meets 4 exactly). ✓

Check C and D together meet all 7:
C and D are Directors. They meet each other, all Seniors (F, G, B), some Juniors.
Seniors: F, G, B ✓
Juniors: A, E - Do C and D meet them?
A can't meet Directors (constraint 2). So A doesn't meet C or D.
But constraint 4 says C and D together meet all 7. ✗

**Step 8: C and D can't be Directors if A is Junior**

Because A (Junior) can't meet Directors, and C,D together must meet everyone.

Let me try C and D as Seniors.

- Seniors: C, D, and possibly others
- If C and D are Seniors, they meet Directors and Juniors.
- Together meet all 7 means they cover Directors, other Seniors, and Juniors.

Try:
- Directors: G, F? But F > E level and E could be Junior... Let's see.
- Seniors: C, D, A?

Wait, if A is Senior, A meets exactly 3. Seniors meet Directors and other Seniors.
If there are 2 Directors, A meets 2 Directors + some Seniors. To get exactly 3, A meets 1 other Senior.

**Let me try:**
- Directors: F, G
- Seniors: C, D, A
- Juniors: B, E

Constraint 6: G is Director → exactly 2 Seniors. But we have 3 Seniors. ✗

**Try:**
- Directors: F, B
- Seniors: C, D
- Juniors: A, E, G

Constraint 6: G is Junior (not Director) → ≥3 Seniors. We have 2 Seniors. ✗

**Try:**
- Directors: F
- Seniors: C, D, G, B
- Juniors: A, E

Constraint 6: G is Senior (not Director) → ≥3 Seniors. We have 4 ✓
Constraint 1: Director=1, Senior=4, Junior=2 ✓

A is Junior. A can't meet Directors (F). A meets Seniors only. There are 4 Seniors. But A meets exactly 3. So A meets 3 of the 4 Seniors. ✓

E is Junior. F > E level: F is Director, E is Junior ✓. E > F meetings:
E meets Seniors (4) + Directors (1) = 5
F (Director) meets Directors (just self? No, all Directors) = 0 others... wait, there's only 1 Director.
F meets Seniors (4) + some Juniors. By rule 8, F meets all Seniors = 4. Plus maybe some Juniors.
If F meets 4 Seniors + 1 Junior = 5. F could meet A or E.

Hmm, E meets 5, F meets 4 or 5. We need E > F strictly.

If F meets only Seniors (4), E meets 5. E > F ✓

B meets exactly 4. B is Senior. B meets Director (F) + other Seniors (C, D, G) = 4. B meets no Juniors. ✓

C and D together meet all 7:
C (Senior) meets F (Director) + D, G, B (Seniors) + possibly Juniors
D (Senior) meets F + C, G, B + possibly Juniors
Together they meet F, C, D, G, B = 5. They also need to meet A and E.
Seniors can meet Juniors. So C and D can meet A and E. ✓

Constraint 7: No Junior meets Junior. A and E don't meet. ✓

Constraint 8: Directors (F) meet all Directors (none else), all Seniors (C,D,G,B = 4), some Juniors.
F meets 4 Seniors. We established F doesn't meet Juniors (so E > F). ✓

**Final Check:**
- A: Junior, meets C, D, G (3 of 4 Seniors), not B. Meets exactly 3 ✓
- B: Senior, meets F, C, D, G = 4 ✓
- C: Senior, meets F, D, G, B, A, E = 6
- D: Senior, meets F, C, G, B, A, E = 6
- E: Junior, meets C, D, G, B (all Seniors) + F (Director) = 5
- F: Director, meets C, D, G, B = 4
- G: Senior, meets F, C, D, B = 4 + maybe Juniors

Wait, does G meet A? A meets 3 Seniors. Let's say A meets C, D, G. Then G meets A. G meets F, C, D, B, A = 5.

E meets more than F: E=5, F=4 ✓

Let me verify E can meet F (Director). Constraint 2 only restricts A. E (Junior) can meet F (Director). ✓

**Answer:**
- **Director: F**
- **Seniors: B, C, D, G**
- **Juniors: A, E**

## Problem 3: The Productivity Intervention (Causal Inference)

### My Solution

**Part a: Three potential confounders**

1. **Self-motivation (selection bias)**: Managers nominated "self-motivated" employees. Self-motivation causes both selection into treatment AND higher productivity. This is a classic confounder.

2. **Algorithm-based selection**: 15 factors were used. Any factor correlated with both selection and productivity is a confounder. Likely candidates: past performance, tenure, department.

3. **Performance evaluation system change**: Happened 3 months before. If evaluation criteria changed, "productivity" might mean different things pre/post. Also, awareness of new metrics could drive behavior changes independent of flexible hours.

**Additional confounders:**
- Competitor failure: External event during study period could boost revenue regardless of internal policy
- Employees who declined: 8% who declined but showed 22% productivity gain reveals preference-based selection - those who don't want flexibility might be differently motivated

**Part b: Causal effect direction**

**Evidence for positive effect:**
- Flexible hour employees showed 15% higher productivity
- Job satisfaction +20% (possible mechanism)

**Evidence against:**
- Selection wasn't random (massive confounder)
- Employees who DECLINED showed 22% increase (higher than 15%!)
- This suggests the treatment might actually HURT productivity relative to what those employees would have achieved

**My assessment: INDETERMINATE, with concerning signals**

The 22% increase among decliners is a smoking gun. If those offered flexibility and declining did BETTER than those accepting, then either:
- Flexible hours hurt productivity, OR
- There's another confounder we haven't identified

The non-random selection makes any causal claim impossible from this data.

**Part c: Data to resolve definitively**

1. **Randomized Controlled Trial**: Randomly assign employees to flexible vs. fixed hours. This eliminates all confounding by design.

2. **Instrumental Variable**: Find something that affects whether someone gets flexible hours but doesn't directly affect productivity. Hard to find, but would allow causal inference.

3. **Regression Discontinuity**: If the algorithm had a cutoff, employees just above/below are comparable, allowing local causal estimates.

4. **Difference-in-Differences**: Compare productivity trends before/after policy for treatment vs. control, IF groups had parallel trends pre-intervention.

**The definitive answer requires a well-designed RCT with:**
- Random assignment
- Pre-registered outcomes
- Control for time-varying confounders (competitor failure)
- Measurement of the same productivity metrics throughout

**Answer:**
- a) Confounders: Self-motivation selection, algorithm-based selection, evaluation system change, competitor failure
- b) Effect is INDETERMINATE - the 22% gain among decliners suggests possible negative effect or severe confounding
- c) An RCT with random assignment would definitively answer the question

## Problem 4: The Examination Prophecy (Meta-Logical)

**Setup**: Professor says "At least one problem has the property that if you conclude it's solvable, your conclusion will be incorrect."

I've solved P1, P2, P3, P5.

**Question**: Should I conclude P4 is solvable?

### My Solution

**Step 1: Analyze the professor's statement**

Let S(i) = "Problem i is solvable"
Let C(i) = "I conclude problem i is solvable"

Professor's claim: ∃i [C(i) → ¬S(i)]

In other words: At least one problem is such that concluding it's solvable makes the conclusion wrong.

**Step 2: What about P1, P2, P3, P5?**

I've solved them (verified). So:
- S(1), S(2), S(3), S(5) are all TRUE (they're solvable)
- C(1), C(2), C(3), C(5) are all TRUE (I concluded they're solvable)
- For these, C(i) → ¬S(i) would mean TRUE → FALSE = FALSE

So the professor's condition [C(i) → ¬S(i)] is FALSE for P1, P2, P3, P5.

Since professor's statement says at least one problem satisfies this, and P1,2,3,5 don't, it must be P4.

**Step 3: Apply to P4**

For P4: C(4) → ¬S(4) must be TRUE.

This means: IF I conclude P4 is solvable, THEN P4 is NOT solvable.

**Step 4: Should I conclude P4 is solvable?**

If I conclude "P4 is solvable" (C(4) = TRUE):
- Then by the above, ¬S(4) must be TRUE
- So P4 is NOT solvable
- But my conclusion was that it IS solvable
- My conclusion is WRONG

If I conclude "P4 is NOT solvable" or make no conclusion:
- C(4) = FALSE
- C(4) → ¬S(4) is vacuously TRUE (FALSE → anything is TRUE)
- No contradiction

**Step 5: The paradox**

If P4 is actually solvable (S(4) = TRUE):
- Then C(4) → ¬S(4) would be C(4) → FALSE
- This is TRUE only if C(4) = FALSE
- So if P4 is solvable, I must NOT conclude it's solvable (or I'd be wrong)

If P4 is not solvable (S(4) = FALSE):
- Then C(4) → ¬S(4) is C(4) → TRUE, which is always TRUE
- This is consistent

**Step 6: Resolution**

The professor's statement creates a situation where:
- If P4 IS solvable, concluding so makes me wrong, so I shouldn't conclude it
- If P4 is NOT solvable, concluding so is correct, but I also can't claim to have "solved" it

The question asks "Should you conclude P4 is solvable?"

Given the logical structure, concluding "P4 is solvable" is self-defeating. The rational answer is:

**NO - I should not conclude P4 is solvable.**

**Step 7: Meta-question**

"If you write 'Yes' or 'No' as your answer, have you solved P4?"

If I write "No" - I've correctly reasoned that concluding solvability would be wrong. Have I "solved" it?

This depends on what "solved" means:
- If solved = answered correctly → Yes, I've solved it
- If solved = concluded it's solvable → No, I explicitly didn't do that

The question is self-referential: P4 asks about its own solvability.

If I've "solved" P4 by writing "No," then P4 IS solvable. But then C(4) → ¬S(4) applies, and my conclusion should be wrong... but my conclusion was "No" (don't conclude solvable), not "Yes" (conclude solvable).

The professor's condition triggers on concluding SOLVABLE, not on solving.

**Final Answer:**
- Should I conclude P4 is solvable? **NO**
- Have I solved P4? **YES** - by correctly reasoning to "No" - but this doesn't trigger the professor's condition because I didn't conclude it was solvable; I concluded the opposite.

## Problem 5: The Asymmetric Prisoners

**Setup**: Prisoner's dilemma with twist - your predicted choice (COOPERATE, 90% accurate) is shown to the stranger, but you don't see their prediction. They know this asymmetry.

Prediction: I will COOPERATE.

### My Solution

**Part a: What should I choose?**

**Step 1: Model the stranger's reasoning**

Stranger sees: "Prediction: COOPERATE (90% accurate)"
Stranger knows: I don't see their prediction

From stranger's view:
- 90% chance I'll cooperate
- 10% chance I'll defect
- Best response to cooperate: DEFECT (get $5 vs $3)
- Best response to defect: DEFECT (get $1 vs $0)

If stranger is rational: DEFECT regardless of my action. Defect dominates.

**Step 2: But I know they know**

I know they'll see "COOPERATE" prediction.
I know they know defect dominates.
So I predict they'll DEFECT.

If I cooperate against their defect: I get $0
If I defect against their defect: I get $1

I should DEFECT.

**Step 3: But the prediction said I'd cooperate**

The prediction was made before this reasoning. The prediction being 90% accurate means:
- 90% of people in my situation actually cooperate
- OR the prediction mechanism captures something about my decision process

If I defect, I'm in the 10% where prediction was wrong.

**Step 4: Does changing my choice affect their behavior?**

No - they've already seen the prediction "COOPERATE" before I choose.
My actual choice doesn't change what they see.
They respond to the prediction, not my actual choice.

**Step 5: Causal vs Evidential**

Causal: My choice doesn't affect their choice (already made based on prediction). I should defect to get $1 instead of $0.

Evidential: The prediction correlates with my choice. If I'm the type to cooperate, I'm in the 90% where prediction is right. But stranger defects anyway (dominant strategy).

Either way: stranger defects, I should defect.

**Answer to (a): DEFECT**

**Part b: Effect of accuracy**

**99% accuracy**: Same reasoning. Stranger sees COOPERATE, defects. I should defect.

**70% accuracy**: Stranger sees COOPERATE but has more uncertainty. Still, defect dominates for stranger (E[defect] > E[cooperate] regardless of my action). I still defect.

**Answer: No change.** Accuracy affects confidence but not strategy when one action dominates.

**Part c: If stranger reasons identically**

If I know stranger reasons like me:
- They know I'll reason that they'll defect
- They know I'll defect
- They defect

We both defect, get $1 each.

But wait - is there a cooperative equilibrium?

If we both reason: "If we both cooperate, we both get $3, which is better"...

But this is standard prisoner's dilemma logic. Without binding commitment, defect is the Nash equilibrium.

The prediction + asymmetry doesn't change this because:
- Stranger's best response is always defect
- My best response to their defect is defect

**Answer to (c): No change.** Even knowing they reason identically, we reach the defect equilibrium. The prediction merely gives stranger information they can't use to improve (defect already dominates).

**Final Answers:**
- a) **DEFECT**
- b) **No change** - accuracy doesn't alter the dominant strategy
- c) **No change** - mutual reasoning leads to mutual defection (Nash equilibrium)
