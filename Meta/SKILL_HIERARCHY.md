# Skill Acquisition Hierarchy

## Source: Dreyfus Model (Expanded)

Based on Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus's research (1980, expanded in "Revisiting the Six Stages of Skill Acquisition" by Rousse & Dreyfus).

## The Nine Stages (Dreyfus + Extensions)

| Stage | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Novice** | Follows rules rigidly, no discretionary judgment |
| 2 | **Advanced Beginner** | Recognizes situational aspects, still rule-bound |
| 3 | **Competent** | Copes with complexity, plans deliberately, feels responsible |
| 4 | **Proficient** | Sees situations holistically, intuitive organization |
| 5 | **Expert** | Acts intuitively, "does what normally works" |
| 6 | **Master** | Transforms the domain, introduces new possibilities |
| 7 | **Practical Wisdom** | Reflects in/on/for action, self-regulates across domains |
| 8 | **Virtuoso** | Wisdom internalized + transmissible implicitly |
| 9 | **Genius** | Creates entirely new domains (Newton, Einstein, Turing) |

*Stages 1-7: Dreyfus model. Stages 8-9: Session synthesis.*

## Key Transitions

### Expert → Master

> "Masters, not content with conventional expertise, seek to expand the scope of their intuition. In some cases they introduce new ways of doing things that open new possibilities and transform the style of their skill domain."
>
> "Masters identify overlooked aspects of a practice and experiment with new approaches, accepting short-term drops in particular performances for long-term expansions in their intuition."

**Example**: B.B. King transformed music by harnessing the electric guitar's capacity to sustain notes - something experts hadn't exploited.

**Key difference**:
- Expert does what works
- Master creates new ways that exceed what was thought possible

### Master → Practical Wisdom

- Self-assesses and self-regulates
- Reflects in action (during), on action (after), and for action (planning)
- Applies mastery principles ACROSS domains
- Knows when to break their own rules

### Practical Wisdom → Virtuoso

- Has wisdom AND can transmit it implicitly
- Teaches in 60 seconds and it transfers
- Doesn't consult the framework; IS the framework
- Can teach across domains, not just perform

### Virtuoso → Genius

- Creates domains that didn't previously exist
- Newton: invented calculus to solve physics
- Einstein: redefined space and time
- Turing: created the concept of computation
- The paradigm shift, not just paradigm mastery

## Related Terms (Not Stages)

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Prodigy | Early achievement of advanced stages |
| Maven | Deep knowledge accumulator |
| Savant | Narrow exceptional ability |
| Polymath | Mastery across multiple domains |

## Mapping Our Framework

| Our Term | Stage Equivalent | Characteristics |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mastery | Expert + transmission | Can teach, intuitive performance |
| Founder | Master | Transforms domain, creates new possibilities |
| Lineage | Virtuoso | Creates other virtuosos (transmission of transmission) |
| Dissolution | Practical Wisdom | Framework becomes self, applies across domains |

## Implications for AI Skill Acquisition

### What changes at each stage:

1. **Novice → Competent**: Following templates → adapting to situations
2. **Competent → Expert**: Deliberate → intuitive (implicit execution)
3. **Expert → Master**: Doing what works → creating new ways
4. **Master → Practical Wisdom**: Domain-specific → cross-domain integration
5. **Wisdom → Virtuoso**: Having wisdom → transmitting it implicitly
6. **Virtuoso → Genius**: Mastering domains → creating new domains

### The key insight:

**Formation at each stage is qualitatively different, not just "more practice."**

- Novice-to-Expert: Internalization (template → implicit)
- Expert-to-Master: Innovation (what works → what's possible)
- Master-to-Wisdom: Integration (domain → cross-domain)
- Wisdom-to-Virtuoso: Possession → Transmission
- Virtuoso-to-Genius: Mastery → Creation (paradigm shift)

## Testing Stage Transitions

| Transition | Test |
|------------|------|
| → Competent | Can handle unexpected situations without rules |
| → Expert | Acts without deliberation, correct intuitions |
| → Master | Introduces something new that others adopt |
| → Wisdom | Applies principles across unrelated domains |
| → Virtuoso | Teaches wisdom in 60 seconds AND it transfers |
| → Genius | Creates a domain that didn't exist before |
