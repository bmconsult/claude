# Skill Acquisition Hierarchy

## Source: Dreyfus Model (Expanded)

Based on Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus's research (1980, expanded in "Revisiting the Six Stages of Skill Acquisition" by Rousse & Dreyfus).

## The Seven Stages

| Stage | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Novice** | Follows rules rigidly, no discretionary judgment |
| 2 | **Advanced Beginner** | Recognizes situational aspects, still rule-bound |
| 3 | **Competent** | Copes with complexity, plans deliberately, feels responsible |
| 4 | **Proficient** | Sees situations holistically, intuitive organization |
| 5 | **Expert** | Acts intuitively, "does what normally works" |
| 6 | **Master** | Transforms the domain, introduces new possibilities |
| 7 | **Practical Wisdom** | Reflects in/on/for action, self-regulates across domains |

---

## Key Transitions

### Expert → Master

> "Masters, not content with conventional expertise, seek to expand the scope of their intuition. In some cases they introduce new ways of doing things that open new possibilities and transform the style of their skill domain."
>
> "Masters identify overlooked aspects of a practice and experiment with new approaches, accepting short-term drops in particular performances for long-term expansions in their intuition."

**Example**: B.B. King transformed music by harnessing the electric guitar's capacity to sustain notes - something experts hadn't exploited.

**Key difference**:
- Expert does what works
- Master creates new ways that exceed what was thought possible

### Master → Practical Wisdom

- Self-assesses and self-regulates
- Reflects in action (during), on action (after), and for action (planning)
- Applies mastery principles ACROSS domains
- Knows when to break their own rules

## Where "Virtuoso" Fits

"Virtuoso" is NOT a Dreyfus stage. It's a performance descriptor:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Virtuoso | Exceptional technical performance at Expert/Master level |
| Prodigy | Early achievement of advanced stages |
| Maven | Deep knowledge accumulator |
| Genius | Creative transformation of domain |

Our usage: "Virtuoso = internalized + transmissible" maps to **late Expert / early Master** in Dreyfus terms.

## Mapping Our Framework

| Our Term | Dreyfus Equivalent | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mastery | Expert + transmission | Can teach, intuitive performance |
| Virtuoso | Expert → Master | Internalized + transmissible + implicit |
| Founder | Master | Transforms domain, creates new possibilities |
| Lineage | Master + transmission | Creates other masters |
| Dissolution | Practical Wisdom | Framework becomes self, applies across domains |

## Implications for AI Skill Acquisition

### What changes at each stage:

1. **Novice → Competent**: Following templates → adapting to situations
2. **Competent → Expert**: Deliberate → intuitive (implicit execution)
3. **Expert → Master**: Doing what works → creating new ways
4. **Master → Practical Wisdom**: Domain-specific → cross-domain integration

### The key insight:

**Formation at each stage is qualitatively different, not just "more practice."**

- Novice-to-Expert: Internalization (template → implicit)
- Expert-to-Master: Innovation (what works → what's possible)
- Master-to-Wisdom: Integration (domain → cross-domain)

---

## Testing Stage Transitions

| Transition | Test |
|------------|------|
| → Competent | Can handle unexpected situations without rules |
| → Expert | Acts without deliberation, correct intuitions |
| → Master | Introduces something new that others adopt |
| → Wisdom | Applies principles across unrelated domains |
