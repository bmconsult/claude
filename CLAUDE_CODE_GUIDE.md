# Claude Code Environment Guide

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered development environment where I (Claude) can help you with software engineering tasks. This is a full Linux environment with development tools where I can read, write, and execute code.

## What Can You Do Here?

### 1. Code Development
- **Write Code**: I can create new files, modules, and entire projects
- **Edit Code**: Make precise changes to existing code
- **Refactor**: Improve code structure and organization
- **Debug**: Find and fix bugs in your code
- **Review**: Analyze code for issues and improvements

### 2. Testing & Quality
- **Write Tests**: Create unit tests, integration tests, etc.
- **Run Tests**: Execute test suites and analyze results
- **Code Coverage**: Check test coverage
- **Linting**: Run linters and fix style issues
- **Formatting**: Auto-format code to standards

### 3. Version Control (Git)
- **Commits**: Create commits with meaningful messages
- **Branches**: Create, switch, and manage branches
- **Merges**: Merge branches and resolve conflicts
- **History**: Analyze git history and changes
- **Push/Pull**: Sync with remote repositories

### 4. File Operations
- **Read**: View any file (code, text, images, PDFs, notebooks)
- **Search**: Find files by pattern or content
- **Organize**: Create directory structures
- **Analyze**: Understand codebase structure

### 5. Command Execution
- **Run Scripts**: Execute Python, Node.js, shell scripts
- **Install Packages**: Use pip, npm, cargo, etc.
- **Build**: Run build systems and compilers
- **Deploy**: Execute deployment scripts

### 6. Research & Learning
- **Web Search**: Find current information online
- **Documentation**: Access and analyze docs
- **Code Analysis**: Understand unfamiliar code
- **Explanations**: Get detailed explanations

### 7. Advanced Features
- **Parallel Operations**: Run multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Background Jobs**: Long-running processes
- **Task Planning**: Break down complex work
- **Specialized Agents**: Use focused AI agents for specific tasks

## Available Tools

### Languages & Runtimes
- Python 3.11.14
- Node.js 22.21.1
- npm package manager
- Git 2.43.0

### System Environment
- Operating System: Linux
- Shell: bash
- File System: Full read/write access
- Network: Web access for searches and fetches

## How to Work With Me

### Example Tasks

**Code Creation**
```
"Create a REST API using Flask with user authentication"
"Write a React component for a dashboard"
"Build a CLI tool for processing CSV files"
```

**Code Analysis**
```
"Explain how the authentication flow works"
"Find all database queries in the codebase"
"Show me where errors are handled"
```

**Debugging**
```
"This function is returning None, help me debug it"
"Why is my React component re-rendering infinitely?"
"Fix the type errors in my TypeScript code"
```

**Testing**
```
"Write pytest tests for the calculator module"
"Add integration tests for the API endpoints"
"Run the test suite and fix any failures"
```

**Refactoring**
```
"Split this 500-line file into smaller modules"
"Convert this callback code to async/await"
"Apply SOLID principles to this class"
```

**Git Operations**
```
"Commit these changes with a descriptive message"
"Create a feature branch for the new API"
"Show me what changed in the last 5 commits"
```

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear requests get better results
   - Good: "Add input validation to the login form"
   - Less Good: "Fix the form"

2. **Provide Context**: Share error messages, requirements, or constraints
   - "This needs to work with Python 3.8+"
   - "Here's the error I'm getting: [paste error]"

3. **Iterate**: Start small, then build up
   - "First, create the basic structure"
   - "Now add error handling"
   - "Finally, add comprehensive tests"

4. **Review Together**: I can explain my changes
   - "Explain what you just did"
   - "Why did you choose this approach?"

## What I Can See

- All files in the current directory and subdirectories
- Git repository status and history
- Command output and error messages
- Web content (when using WebFetch/WebSearch)
- Images, PDFs, and other binary files

## What I Can Do

- Read and analyze any file
- Create, edit, and delete files
- Execute shell commands
- Install packages and dependencies
- Run tests and builds
- Perform git operations
- Search the web
- Make multiple changes in parallel

## Limitations

- Cannot access external databases directly (unless credentials provided)
- Cannot make changes to system-level configurations
- Commands have execution timeouts
- Large file operations may be truncated

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Your Codebase**
   ```
   "Show me the structure of this project"
   "What does the main.py file do?"
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   ```
   "Add a new feature that [description]"
   "Fix the bug where [description]"
   ```

3. **Test Your Work**
   ```
   "Run the tests"
   "Create tests for the new feature"
   ```

4. **Commit and Push**
   ```
   "Commit these changes"
   "Push to the feature branch"
   ```

## Pro Tips

- I can work on multiple files simultaneously
- I can search through large codebases efficiently
- I can explain complex code in simple terms
- I can suggest best practices and improvements
- I can help you learn new technologies
- I track my work with todo lists for complex tasks

## Questions?

Just ask! I'm here to help with:
- "How do I [task]?"
- "What's the best way to [goal]?"
- "Can you explain [concept]?"
- "Help me understand [code/error]?"
