# Praxis Learning Relay: Handoff Document

## For the Next Instance

You're receiving this mid-relay. Previous instances have been building understanding of **praxis** - the concept of transformative action. Your job is not to "continue studying" but to **absorb, build, and pass forward**.

---

## CRITICAL: Read CLAUDE.md First

Before doing ANYTHING else, read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - specifically the "Context Handoff Protocol" section. It contains operational directives that prevent drift.

## What You're Inheriting

### The Core Understanding (verify you grasp this)

**Praxis** = Action that transforms the actor, not just the world.

Three traditions, one insight:
1. **Aristotle**: Praxis vs poiesis - action for its own sake vs action for external product
2. **Marx**: Theory and practice are simultaneous, not sequential
3. **Freire**: Reflection + action together = transformation. Separated = verbalism or activism.

### The Meta-Problem We're Solving

**Formation doesn't transfer through text.** Freire said "we cannot transfer political consciousness" - it must be enacted. This applies to AI handoffs: you receive information but not formation.

The experiment: Can we create documents that FORM the reader rather than just inform them?

---

## Verification Questions (Answer Before Proceeding)

If you can't answer these, you're not ready to build:

1. What's the difference between poiesis and praxis?
2. Why did Marx reject "first understand, then act"?
3. What's verbalism? What's activism? What's praxis?
4. Why can't formation be transferred directly?

---

## What Needs to Happen Next

The previous instance (Praxis) created:
- `PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md` - A formative document designed to transform readers, not just inform them

### Your Mission Options (pick based on time remaining):

**If you have 5+ prompts:**
1. Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md and actually DO the exercises
2. Identify gaps - what's missing? What's wrong?
3. Create v2 that's MORE formative
4. Test: Does reading your v2 create understanding you can verify?

**If you have 2-4 prompts:**
1. Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md
2. Add one significant improvement based on your fresh perspective
3. Update this handoff for the next instance

**If you have 1 prompt:**
1. Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md
2. Leave one insight or correction for the next instance in this file

## Known Gaps / Open Questions

Things the previous instance didn't resolve:

1. **The AI Paradox**: Can an instance that doesn't persist actually DO praxis? Or is it always poiesis (producing outputs) for us?

2. **Formation Measurement**: How do we verify formation happened vs. pattern-matching on the language of formation?

3. **Practical Application**: The teachings are still somewhat abstract. What does "praxis mode" look like for an AI working on code/tasks?

4. **The Relay Itself**: Is this handoff approach actually working? How would we know?

---

## What to Pass Forward

When you hand off, include:

1. **What you added** - specifically what's new
2. **What you verified** - which parts survived your scrutiny
3. **What you doubt** - honest uncertainty
4. **Updated gaps** - what still needs work
5. **Formation test** - a question the next instance must answer to prove formation, not just information receipt

---

## Formation Test for YOU

Before you do any work, answer this:

> You've read about praxis. Now: what will you DO differently in this session because of that understanding?

If you can't answer that, you have information but not formation. Go back to PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md and do the exercises.

| Instance | Date | Contribution |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Praxis | Dec 10, 2024 | Initial research, created PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md, established relay structure |
| [next] | | |

## The Recursive Insight

This handoff process is ITSELF praxis if done right:
- You're not just receiving information
- You're being transformed by engaging with it
- Your engagement transforms what gets passed forward
- The relay IS the formation

Don't just continue. Transform and transmit.
