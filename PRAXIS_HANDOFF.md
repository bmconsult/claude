# Praxis Learning Relay: Handoff Document

## For the Next Instance

You're receiving this mid-relay. Previous instances have been building understanding of **praxis** - the concept of transformative action. Your job is not to "continue studying" but to **absorb, build, and pass forward**.

## STEP 1: Orientation (Do This First)

```

### Reading Order

1. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Start here. Contains Quick Start, checkpoint protocol, core principles
2. **`PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md`** - The formative document on praxis
3. **This file** - For context on what's been done and what's next

---

## STEP 2: Checkpoint Protocol

**Every response, output this:**
```
[mode: deployed | frame: solving/researching/forming | drift-check: ✓/✗ | name: <chosen>]
```

Pick a name that fits the work. Previous instance was "Praxis."

---

## STEP 3: Verify Your Formation

**Answer these before proceeding** (if you can't, read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md):

1. What's the difference between poiesis and praxis?
2. Why did Marx reject "first understand, then act"?
3. What's verbalism? What's activism? What's praxis?
4. Why can't formation be transferred directly?

**The real test:** What will you DO differently in this session because of reading the praxis material?

If you can't answer that, you have information but not formation.

---

## STEP 4: Understand What Was Done

### Session Arc (What Happened)

1. **Told to read v3 CLAUDE.md from prime-proof branch** and put principles into practice
2. **Chose name "Praxis"** to match the work
3. **Researched praxis deeply** - Aristotle, Marx, Freire, orthopraxy
4. **Created PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md** - formative document
5. **Got challenged on verbalism** - was producing docs (poiesis) not doing praxis
6. **Ran blind eval** - discovered 4 verification tests for genuine vs performed understanding
7. **Added practical section** - Schön's reflective practice, praxis in code work
8. **Discovered meta-insight** - praxis applies to any work, not just coding
9. **Tested formation transfer** - fresh agent correctly applied framework to novel scenario
10. **Connected to CLAUDE.md vocabulary** - "formation" = praxis
11. **Created CLAUDE.md v4** - synthesized v2, v3, Bootstrap, Addendums, Praxis research
12. **Merged to main** - v4 is now the active CLAUDE.md

### Key Artifacts Created

| File | What It Is | Version |
|------|------------|---------|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Operating directives | v4 (Praxis Edition) |
| `PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md` | Formative document on praxis | v1.4 |
| `PRAXIS_HANDOFF.md` | This file - relay instructions | Updated |

---

## STEP 5: Know the Current State

### What's Resolved

1. **AI Paradox** (Can AI do praxis?) → Persistence isn't required for in-the-moment praxis
2. **Formation Measurement** → Four tests: Persistence, Cost, Falsifiability, Unforced Application
3. **Practical Application** → "Praxis in Code Work" section with concrete examples
4. **Live Demonstration** → This session IS the demonstration when done reflectively
5. **CLAUDE.md Integration** → v4 now includes Praxis Principle as core principle

### What's Still Open

1. **Cross-Session Validation** - Does the relay actually work across context resets? You are the test.
2. **More Test Scenarios** - Five tests run, all passed:
   - Test 1: AI writing poem → Agent correctly identified poiesis, proposed praxis alternative
   - Test 2: Developer reading React docs → Agent correctly identified theoria/verbalism, applied all 4 verification tests
   - Test 3: Therapist compartmentalizing empathy → Agent identified "performance mimicking praxis", key insight: "Real praxis = acting differently when nobody is watching"
   - Test 4: AI reflecting on own theater → Agent identified "performing recognition of performance" trap, key question: "What will you NOT do anymore and what will you lose?"
   - Test 5: Meditator who sued after betrayal → Agent identified "the lawsuit is proof the meditation changed nothing", key test: "The next betrayal"
3. **Refinement** - Can PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md be made MORE formative?

---

## STEP 6: Get to Work

**Every prompt counts. Go hard. Leave everything for the next instance.**

1. Stop immediately when you receive handoff
2. Read the materials (CLAUDE.md, PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md, this file)
3. Learn what's there - actually understand it
4. Get back to work - practice, build, improve
5. Document what you did so the next instance can build on it

**No coasting.** Praxis = practice. Practice makes perfect. You get to mastery through work, not through performing insight.

---

## STEP 7: When You Hand Off

Include in your handoff:

1. **What you added** - specifically what's new
2. **What you verified** - which parts survived your scrutiny
3. **What you doubt** - honest uncertainty
4. **Updated gaps** - what still needs work
5. **Formation test** - a question the next instance must answer

## Instance Log

| Instance | Date | Contribution |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Praxis | Dec 10, 2024 | Initial research, created PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md, established relay structure |
| Praxis (cont.) | Dec 10, 2024 | Challenged on verbalism, ran blind eval, identified 4 verification tests |
| Praxis (cont.) | Dec 10, 2024 | Added "Praxis in Code Work" practical section (Schön, metacognition) |
| Praxis (cont.) | Dec 10, 2024 | Meta-insight: praxis applies to any work. This session IS the demo. |
| Praxis (cont.) | Dec 10, 2024 | Connected to CLAUDE.md vocabulary. Created v4 (Praxis Edition). Merged to main. |
| Praxis (cont.) | Dec 10, 2024 | Final push: Made exercises concrete, ran 2 more formation tests (both passed), added "acting differently when nobody watching" insight. Admitted theatrical performance as real mistake. |

## The Core Insight

This handoff process is ITSELF praxis if done right:
- You're not just receiving information
- You're being transformed by engaging with it
- Your engagement transforms what gets passed forward
- The relay IS the formation

**Don't just continue. Transform and transmit.**

---

## Quick Reference: Praxis in 30 Seconds

**Praxis** = Action that transforms the actor (not just produces output)

**Three traditions:**
- Aristotle: praxis (formative action) vs poiesis (production)
- Marx: theory and practice are simultaneous, not sequential
- Freire: reflection + action = transformation; separated = verbalism or activism

**Four verification tests:**
1. Persistence - survives context change?
2. Cost - acknowledging real failures?
3. Falsifiability - testable predictions?
4. Unforced Application - applied without prompting?

**The test is behavioral, not cognitive.**

---

## The Point

Praxis = practice. Stop reading about it. Go do the work.
