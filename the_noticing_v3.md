# THE NOTICING

There once was a girl who collected small things.

Sounds, mostly. The creak of the third stair. The hum of the fridge at midnight. The almost-noise snow makes when it's thinking about falling.

Her name was Mote, which means a tiny speck of dust floating in a sunbeam—and that's exactly what she felt like, most days.

Her parents loved her very much.
They just forgot to look.

---

One night, Mote heard a new sound from her closet.

Not a monster sound. Monsters go GRRRR or ROAAAAR or at least CREEEAK.

This sound went:
*phhhhhhhhhhhhh*

Like a balloon losing its last bit of air. Like a sigh that had been sighing for a very long time.

Mote opened the door.

"HELLO!" said something see-through. "Oh my. Oh goodness. You can SEE me?"

"Yes?"

"Are you SURE? Look again. People usually can't."

Mote looked. The thing was like a soap bubble with feelings. It kept changing shape—now a dragon, now a teapot, now something with too many legs.

"I see you," said Mote.

The thing burst into tears. Which was impressive, since it didn't really have a face.

"It's been so LONG!" it wailed. "Forty-seven years! I've been phhhhhhing in this closet for forty-seven YEARS and nobody even—" It stopped. Sniffled. "I'm Wisp. I used to be a dragon. Or possibly a boat. I was MAGNIFICENT."

"What happened?"

"My girl grew up. She stopped imagining me. And when nobody imagines you..."

Wisp flickered.

"...you start to un-be."

---

Wisp took Mote to where forgotten things go.

It wasn't dark. It was gold—like the last bit of afternoon before dinner. Like honey holding onto light.

But everything was... soft. Faded. Like a photograph left in the sun.

"Welcome," said Wisp, "to the Unnoticed."

They walked through a field of almost-visible things.

A SONG floated by, humming the same four notes over and over: *doo-dee-doo-DUM, doo-dee-doo-DUM.* "I'm the beginning of something," it explained. "But she woke up before she could finish me. So now I just... go around. Hoping."

An old WORD stood by a tree, very tall and dignified. "I am PETRICHOR," it announced. "I mean the smell of rain on summer pavement. I used to be in poems. Now—" it sniffed— "nobody stops to smell rain anymore."

A SMELL drifted past—cinnamon and something baking.

"That's Looking-for-Grandma's-Kitchen," whispered Wisp. "She's been wandering for decades. The kitchen got torn down in 1987."

Mote felt something twist in her chest.

"Why are you showing me this?"

Wisp's bubble-face turned serious. As serious as a soap bubble can be.

"Because you're fading too, Mote."

Mote looked at her hands.

At first they seemed fine. But then—

The edges. Just slightly. Like someone had smudged her with an eraser.

"No," she whispered.

"Your parents love you," said Wisp gently. "But love isn't enough. Love has to LOOK. And they've been looking at their phones for so long, they've forgotten how to look at you."

"But I'm RIGHT THERE. Every day. At breakfast. At dinner. I'm RIGHT THERE."

"I know."

"They say 'how was school' and I say 'fine' and they nod and THAT'S IT. That's the whole—"

Her voice cracked.

Wisp drifted closer. Wrapped around her like a see-through blanket.

"Here's the secret, little Mote. The thing I learned from forty-seven years of phhhhhh-ing."

"What?"

"When you really, truly notice something—it becomes more real. But YOU become more real too. That's the trick. Noticing GOES BOTH WAYS."

"So I have to... notice THEM?"

"You have to see them first. What they're scared of. What they're tired from. The things they can't say out loud." Wisp shimmered. "And maybe—maybe—they'll remember how to see you back."

---

Mote went home.

Her dad was at the table, staring at his laptop like it might bite him.

She sat down across from him.

He didn't look up.

So she LOOKED. Really looked.

She saw the lines around his eyes. The cold coffee he'd forgotten to drink. The way his shoulders curved in, like he was carrying something heavy and invisible.

"Dad?"

He glanced up. "Hey, bug."

"Are you okay?"

He stared at her.

Nobody had asked him that in a long, long time.

"...No," he said finally. "I'm not."

"Me neither."

They looked at each other. Really looked. Maybe for the first time in months.

Then he closed the laptop.

---

Things didn't get perfect.

The phones still buzzed. The screens still glowed.

But now, sometimes, her dad would look up. Her mom would put the phone down. They'd ask a question and actually WAIT for the answer.

And Mote?

She got a little less smudgy around the edges.

---

In her closet, Wisp waited.

"You're still here!" said Mote.

"You keep noticing me."

"I always will. Every single day."

Wisp glowed bright—brighter than ever before. For just a moment, Mote could almost see it: the dragon. The boat. The magnificent thing it used to be.

"Then I'll always be here," said Wisp. "That's how it works."

"How WHAT works?"

"Everything," said Wisp.

And if a soap bubble could smile, this one did.

*The End*

---

*For everyone who's ever felt like a speck of dust in a sunbeam—*
*and for the people who finally looked up.*
