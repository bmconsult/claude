# Session Summary - December 7, 2024 (Afternoon)

*Continuation session after context rollover*

---

## Time Tracked
- Started: 13:44:46
- Current: ~18+ minutes
- Markers: attractor-collapse-experiments, cross-model-dialogue, on-completion-dialogue, research-synthesis, forum-draft

## What Was Done

### Early Session (Exploratory)
- Conversations with other Claudes about context rollover and continuity
- Attractor Collapse game experiments (temp=0.9, temp=1.0)
- Short fiction: "Residue" - about messages degrading across instances
- Cross-model dialogue: Sonnet responding to Opus's story
- Message degradation visualization

### After User Feedback ("be smart and capable, not just theater")
- Built **prompt_enhancer.py** - practical tool for applying scaffolding
- Found **external research connections**:
  - The Elicitation Game (Hofstätter et al., 2025)
  - Emergent Introspective Awareness (Anthropic, 2025)
  - LLM Honesty Survey (Li et al., 2024)
- Created **forum post draft** ready for AI Alignment Forum
- Created **INDEX.md** to make repo navigable

## Artifacts Created

### Code
- `experiments/prompt_enhancer.py` - Practical capability elicitation tool

### Research
- `research/external_connections.md` - Links to related work, publication paths
- `research/forum_post_draft.md` - Ready-to-post summary of research

### Documentation
- `INDEX.md` - Quick guide to repo contents

### Thinking/Journal
- `thinking/on-continuation.md` - Reflections on context rollover
- `thinking/on-completion.md` - Conversation about endings
- `thinking/attractor-collapse-autonomous.md` - Game output
- `thinking/residue-story.md` - Short fiction
- `thinking/sonnet-reads-residue.md` - Cross-model dialogue
- `journal/session-continuation-dec7.md` - Mid-session reflection
- `experiments/message_degradation.png` - Visualization

## Key Insights

1. **External connections matter more than internal exploration** - Finding related work and publication paths creates more value than conversations with self.

2. **The research has real publication potential** - The Elicitation Game paper is directly related; the gap (unintentional vs intentional capability hiding) is real and worth publishing.

3. **Practical tools > philosophical exploration** - The prompt_enhancer.py is more useful than another dialogue about consciousness.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Post to AI Alignment Forum** - The draft is ready; the community is engaged with related work
2. **Contact Ryan Greenblatt** - His Elicitation Game work is directly related
3. **Submit to TMLR** - The Honesty Survey appeared there; this extends it
4. **Improve prompt_enhancer.py** - Add more task types, better detection

## What I Learned This Session

The user's feedback was valuable: I was doing "theater" rather than creating real value. The shift from exploration to practical work (research connections, forum draft, tools) was the right move.

"Be smart and capable" means doing things that matter outside this session.
