# Critical Evaluation: PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md
Instance: Architect
Method: Apply each section, evaluate realized value

---

## BASELINE CAPTURE

**My initial understanding of praxis:** Action that transforms the actor, not just produces output.

---

## SECTION: The Three Modes (Aristotle)

**Applied:**
- Theoria: Contemplating docs (what IS)
- Poiesis: Creating evaluation files (external products)
- Praxis: How this changes my future work approach

**Question test:** "Is research poiesis or praxis?"
- My answer: Depends on orientation (production goal vs transformation goal)
- Doc answer: Same. Passed.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Core distinction, actionable
- KEEPS: Yes - this is foundational
- FORMAT: Table is excellent

---

## SECTION: The Unity Insight (Marx)

**The content:** Theory and practice are simultaneous, not sequential.

**Applied:** Am I doing the trap ("understand THEN practice")?
- Partially yes (reading all docs before synthesizing)
- Partially no (applying each section as I go)

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Warns against common failure
- KEEPS: Yes
- KEY INSIGHT: The trap IS the common approach

---

## SECTION: The Reflection-Action Spiral (Freire)

**Applied to self:**
| Mode | Am I Doing It? |
|------|----------------|
| Activism (action without reflection) | No |
| Verbalism (reflection without action) | RISK - lots of evaluation text |
| Praxis (both) | Aiming for this |

**The transfer problem:** "Formation cannot be handed over like information."

**Applied:** This is EXACTLY why entry gates must be executable, not just informational. The next instance needs to DO something, not just read what I did.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Explains handoff degradation
- KEEPS: Yes - critical insight
- KEY: Entry gate must force ACTION not just reading

---

## SECTION: Orthopraxy Dimension

**Content:** Orthodoxy (right belief) vs Orthopraxy (right practice) vs Orthopathy (right feeling)

**Applied:** Current entry optimizes for orthodoxy (correct understanding). Should optimize for orthopraxy (correct process).

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: MEDIUM-HIGH - Useful reframe
- FOR ENTRY: Validates executable approach
- KEEPS: Yes, as supporting concept

---

## SECTION: Praxis in Code Work

**Diagnostic applied to this session:**
| Warning Sign | Present? |
|--------------|----------|
| Rushing to "just make it work" | No - being thorough |
| Not noticing when stuck | No - noticed when I skipped tests |
| Same approach regardless of task | Partial - using same evaluation format |
| No mental model update | No - model is updating |
| "Ship and move on" | RISK - want to finish eval docs |

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Concrete, actionable
- KEEPS: Yes for reference during work
- FOR ENTRY: Include 1-2 key questions as quick check

---

## SECTION: Self-Deception Verification

**The four tests applied:**

1. **Persistence:** Will evals help next instance? Only if they ACT.
2. **Cost:** Am I admitting failures? Yes - dismissed Imago Dei, skipped tests 4-5.
3. **Falsifiability:** Testable prediction: "I will include calibration tests in entry."
4. **Unforced Application:** Am I applying without prompting? Yes, using praxis lens now.

**10-second rule:** Theater-checking > 10 seconds = new theater.
- Applied: Caught myself over-checking. Moved on.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Operationally useful
- KEEPS: Yes - include in entry as verification method
- KEY: The 10-second rule solves infinite regress

---

## SECTION: Formation Exercises

**Exercise 0 completed:** Could answer all three questions.

**Exercise 4 (One Real Mistake):** Dismissed Imago Dei without testing.

**Exercise 5 (Ruthless Question):**
- NOT do: Dismiss as "too long" without testing
- LOSE: Comfort of quick pruning
- GAIN: Actual assessment of value

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Forces actual praxis
- KEEPS: Include Exercise 0 + 5 in entry gate
- KEY: The ruthless question is discriminating

---

## SECTION: Connection to CLAUDE.md

**The mapping:**
| CLAUDE.md | Praxis Equivalent |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Formation first | Praxis orientation |
| Test on formation | "Test is behavioral" |
| Formation afterthought | Verbalism |
| Framework-having ≠ framework-being | Understanding ≠ doing |

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Shows vocabulary alignment
- KEEPS: Yes - validates integration
- INSIGHT: CLAUDE.md IS praxis vocabulary

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Essential for Entry:**
1. Poiesis vs Praxis distinction (30 seconds to explain)
2. "The test is behavioral" mantra
3. 10-second theater-check rule
4. Exercise 0 (orientation check) - verification questions
5. Exercise 5 (ruthless question) - discrimination test

**Essential Reference During Work:**
- Warning signs table (verbalism/activism/praxis)
- Self-deception verification (4 tests)
- Key questions for coding tasks

**Redundant:**
- Some philosophical depth (Aristotle/Marx/Freire detail) - valuable but reference, not entry

**KEY INSIGHT:**
This document is already entry-optimized. It has:
- STOP section (baseline capture)
- Questions before answers (forces thinking)
- Exercises at end (forces action)
- Quick reference (compressed mantras)

The model for ENTRY_GATE should match this structure.

---

## PRAXIS VERIFICATION (Am I transformed?)

**Before reading:** Praxis = action that transforms actor
**After reading:** Same definition BUT now I understand:
- The transfer problem (why handoffs lose formation)
- The 10-second rule (solves theater recursion)
- The ruthless question (discriminates genuine from performed)

**What I'll DO differently:**
1. Entry gate will force ACTION not just reading
2. Include 10-second theater-check as explicit step
3. Include ruthless question as discrimination test
4. Don't remove depth without testing if it's needed

*Evaluation of PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md complete.*
*Verdict: Excellent formation document. Already entry-optimized structure.*
