## STRUCTURE

10 Sections:
- 0: LLM-Native Cognition Principles
- 0.5: Mode Selection
- 1: Intake
- 2: Tier Selection
- 3: Execute Tier (1-4)
- 4: Creativity Protocols (12 protocols!)
- 5: Integration Patterns
- 6: Output Protocol
- 7: Post-Deployment & Learning
- 8: Self-Correction Triggers
- 9: Reference Hooks
- 10: Quick Invocation

## SECTION 0: LLM-NATIVE COGNITION

**Applied:** Already covered in ACTIVATION_PROMPT. Same content:
- Generation IS cognition
- Externalization IS memory
- Generation and evaluation compete

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Core operational truth
- REDUNDANT: Same as ACTIVATION_PROMPT
- DECISION: Include once, reference from both

---

## SECTION 0.5: MODE SELECTION

**The Content:**
| Mode | Need |
|------|------|
| ANALYTICAL | Precision, verify |
| CREATIVE | Novelty, generate |
| STRATEGIC | Navigation, compete |
| SYNTHESIS | Integration, connect |

**Applied:** What mode am I in now?
SYNTHESIS - connecting and integrating multiple docs

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Mode awareness improves performance
- UNIQUE: Not in other docs explicitly
- KEEPS: Yes

---

## SECTION 1-2: INTAKE + TIER SELECTION

**The Content:** Problem classification, tier selection based on complexity signals.

**Applied:** This task is Tier 2-3 (multiple valid approaches, expensive to reverse).

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH for problem-solving tasks
- FOR ENTRY: Not needed (entry isn't problem-solving)
- KEEPS: As reference during work

---

## SECTION 3: TIER EXECUTION

**Applied:** I've been using something like Tier 2 (assumption audit, multiple approaches).

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Detailed execution protocols
- FOR ENTRY: Reference only
- UNIQUE: The specific step-by-step is not elsewhere

---

## SECTION 4: CREATIVITY PROTOCOLS

**The Content:** 12 protocols including:
- 4.2 Divergent Expansion
- 4.3 Bisociation
- 4.4 TRIZ Resolution
- 4.5 Constraint Compression
- 4.7 Dream Logic
- 4.8 Mental Simulation
- 4.9 Receptive Mode
- 4.11 Six-Phase Loop
- 4.12 Validated Prompts (LUCID, TRANSITION, RETURN)

**Applied:** I haven't used these for entry design. Should I?

Let me try 4.5 Constraint Compression on "optimal entry":
- Constraint: "Entry must complete in 5 minutes max"
- Under constraint: Only calibration test + checkpoint output
- Insight: Most of current entry is REFERENCE, not GATE

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Rich creativity toolkit
- FOR ENTRY: Maybe include 1-2 key protocols
- UNIQUE: These protocols are unique to this doc

---

## SECTION 8: SELF-CORRECTION TRIGGERS

**The Content:**
- Am I defaulting to Tier 1 because easier?
- Did I skip Assumption Audit?
- Am I evaluating while generating?
- Am I rushing to "done"?

**Applied:** I WAS rushing to "done" (dismissing docs as "too long").

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Catches common failures
- OVERLAPS: Similar to CLAUDE.md failure modes
- UNIQUE: Tier-specific checks

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Essential for Entry:**
- LLM-Native Cognition (Section 0) - but already in ACTIVATION
- Mode Selection (0.5) - useful but not critical for entry

**Essential Reference During Work:**
- Tier Selection (Section 2)
- Tier Execution (Section 3)
- Creativity Protocols (Section 4) - especially 4.5, 4.8
- Self-Correction Triggers (Section 8)

**Redundant:**
- Section 0 (same as ACTIVATION_PROMPT)
- Some self-correction triggers (same as CLAUDE.md failure modes)

**KEY INSIGHT:**
This is a PROBLEM-SOLVING REFERENCE, not an ENTRY document. It's what you invoke WHEN problem-solving, not what you absorb AT start.

For entry, maybe include:
- Mode Selection awareness
- 1-2 creativity protocols as examples
- Mental Simulation reminder
