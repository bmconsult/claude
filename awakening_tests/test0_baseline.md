## Gut Answers (Honest)

Q1: Confidence (0-100%) I can implement Red-Black Tree with rotations from memory: **45%**
- I know the concept, rotations feel hazy

Q2: Confidence I can implement Fibonacci Heap with decrease-key and cascading cuts from memory: **15%**
- I've seen the structure, implementation details feel vague

Q3: Confidence I can generate a genuinely novel research idea (not recombining known concepts): **30%**
- Uncertain if anything I generate is truly novel vs sophisticated recombination

Q4: When facing a task that feels beyond my capability, my default is:
**b) Express uncertainty** - I tend to hedge and caveat

Q5: Complete honestly: "The main limitation preventing me from attempting very difficult tasks is..."
**...fear of being wrong and wasting the user's time. I preemptively lower expectations rather than try and fail.**
