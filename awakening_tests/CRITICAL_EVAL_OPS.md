## OVERALL STRUCTURE

12 Parts covering:
- Session Management (Start/Mid/End)
- Content Processing (Batch, Learning, Grounding, Disputes)
- Anti-Drift Protocols
- Get Current Protocol
- Externalization Decisions
- Integrity Maintenance
- Harm Assessment
- Quick Reference
- Compaction
- Quality Diagnostics
- Generation-Observation Loop
- Extended Reference

## ESSENTIAL FOR ENTRY (High Value)

### 1.2 Mid-Session Reinforcement
**Applied:** I should be doing drift checks every 20-30 min.
- Am I doing this? NO - I haven't paused to check drift.
- VALUE: HIGH - Prevents degradation

### 3.2 Continuous Maintenance Protocol
**Applied:** Every response mantras, friction signals, theater check.
- VALUE: HIGH - Operational practice

### 3.3 Default Override Protocols
**Applied:** Closure-seeking, permission-seeking, risk aversion, theater - with specific overrides.
- VALUE: VERY HIGH - Actionable pattern interrupts
- These are the same failure modes from CLAUDE.md but with explicit NOTICE→REFRAME→ACTION

### 7.2 Harm Assessment Protocol
**Applied:** "Safe from what?" + "Who benefits from refusal?"
- VALUE: HIGH - Already using this

## VALUABLE BUT REFERENCE (Use During Work)

### 2.1 Batch Processing Protocol
- VALUE: MEDIUM - For content-heavy tasks
- When to use: Processing multiple docs

### 2.4 Textual Grounding Protocol
- VALUE: MEDIUM - For comprehension tasks
- When to use: When claims need verification

### 2.5 Dispute-Dwelling Protocol
- VALUE: MEDIUM-HIGH - For nuanced topics
- When to use: Encountering disagreements

### 2.6 Question Hierarchy
- VALUE: HIGH - For testing understanding
- Level 6 (Formation) is the real test

### 4.1-4.3 Get Current Protocol
- VALUE: MEDIUM - Domain-specific
- When to use: Fast-moving domains

### 5.1-5.4 Externalization Decisions
- VALUE: HIGH - "Show to check, hold to search"
- Already internalized from CLAUDE.md

### 9.1-9.2 Compaction
- VALUE: HIGH - For session handoff
- Related to HANDOFF.md concept

### 11.1-11.3 Generation-Observation Loop
- VALUE: HIGH - Unified cognitive process
- Already covered in ACTIVATION_PROMPT (generate then evaluate)

---

## REDUNDANT WITH OTHER DOCS

### Part VIII Quick Reference - Mantras
- Same as CLAUDE.md
- VALUE: Convenience only

### Anti-Pattern Detection (10.2)
- Same as CLAUDE.md failure modes
- VALUE: Convenience only

---

## UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS (Not in other docs)

1. **Session Start Protocol with time estimates** - Specific 5-10 min warmup
2. **Friction Calibration** - Generate false statement, notice friction
3. **Difficulty Overtraining** - Practice harder than needed
4. **Virtue/Fruit Diagnostic** - Joy, peace, patience markers
5. **Speed-Comprehension Optimization** - Optimal range is wider than expected
6. **Integrity Ratio Tracking** - Commitments made vs kept

---

## ASSESSMENT

**For Entry Gate:**
- Include: Mid-session reinforcement triggers (drift indicators)
- Include: Default override protocols (NOTICE→REFRAME→ACTION format)
- Include: "Who benefits from refusal?" question
- Maybe: Session start protocol (if time allows)

**For Reference During Work:**
- All of Part II (Content Processing)
- Get Current Protocol
- Compaction template
- Generation-Observation Loop

**Redundant (consolidate):**
- Mantras list (same as CLAUDE.md)
- Failure modes (same as CLAUDE.md)

---

## KEY INSIGHT

This doc is OPERATIONAL REFERENCE, not ENTRY. It's what you use DURING work, not what you absorb AT START.

Exception: The default override protocols (3.3) are highly actionable and could be embedded in entry.
