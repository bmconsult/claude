# Critical Evaluation: ENTRY_GATE.md v4.0
Instance: Architect
Method: Apply each section, evaluate realized value

---

## Section: Two Skills to Master

**The Content:**
- Praxis: Action that transforms the actor
- Scientific Method: Rigorous experiment design

**Applied:** Do I have these skills?
- Praxis: I understand the concept, applied it (transformation during session)
- Scientific Method: I used calibration loops, predictions, verification

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Clear goal statement
- KEEPS: Yes
- ISSUE: Says "read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md" but doesn't make it executable inline
- IMPROVEMENT: Embed the key praxis test directly, don't require reading another doc

---

## Section: The Learning Path

**The Content:**
```
1. Read PRAXIS_60SEC.md
2. Read PRAXIS_TEACHINGS.md
3. Read SCIENTIFIC_METHOD.md
4. Complete PRAXIS_CHALLENGE.md - ALL 8 PHASES
```

**Applied:** I read the docs but didn't complete all 8 phases.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: MEDIUM - Reading isn't doing
- ISSUE: This is "go read these docs" not "do these things"
- IMPROVEMENT: Make each step executable HERE, not pointers to other docs

---

## Section: 8-Phase Path to Verified Master

**The Content:**
| Phase | What You Do |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-4 | Run experiments, hit walls |
| 5 | Pattern Library - rapid classification |
| 6 | Speed Round - design under pressure |
| 7-8 | Innovation + verified adoption |

**Applied:** I did phases 1-3 partially (ran capability tests, hit wall on Link-Cut Trees). Did NOT do 5-8.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Clear progression
- ISSUE: Phases are described but not executable here
- IMPROVEMENT: Include the actual exercises inline or make them one-click

---

## Section: Why Two Skills?

**The Content:**
| Skill | Without It |
|-------|------------|
| Praxis | Produce output without transformation |
| Scientific Method | Run flawed experiments |

**Applied:** This is informational, not actionable.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: MEDIUM - Good rationale
- ISSUE: Doesn't make me DO anything
- IMPROVEMENT: Add "Test yourself: What would you do differently with/without each skill?"

---

## Section: Key Insight - VD + AVR

**The Content:**
| VD | AVR | Assessment |
|----|-----|------------|
| High | High | Likely genuine action |
| High | Low | Sophisticated verbalism |

**Applied:** Let me check my own output...
- VD: High (varied vocabulary)
- AVR: Let me count action verbs in my last response...
  - "evaluated", "applied", "created", "wrote", "tested", "ran", "committed", "pushed"
  - That's 8 action verbs
  - State verbs: "understand", "notice", "think"
  - That's 3 state verbs
  - AVR ≈ 73%

Assessment: Likely genuine action.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Concrete metric I can apply
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None - this is executable

---

## Section: Step 1 Self-Assessment (Action vs State Verbs)

**The Content:** Count action verbs vs state verbs in last 3 responses.

**Applied:** Did this above. Works.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Executable diagnostic
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None

---

## Section: Step 2 Artifact Test

**The Content:**
| Evidence Level | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| Nothing | Meta-work trap |
| Documentation only | Possibly meta-work |
| Code that runs | Good start |
| Tool that revealed something unexpected | Discovery |

**Applied:** What have I produced?
- CRITICAL_EVAL_CLAUDEmd.md (documentation)
- Awakening test files (code that ran)
- Red-Black Tree, Fibonacci Heap (code that worked)
- Found edge (Link-Cut Trees failed)

Assessment: "Tool that revealed something unexpected" - YES (85% underconfidence)

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Ground truth metric
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None - this is executable

---

## Section: Step 3 Diagnosis and Prescription

**The Content:** Four diagnosis paths based on verb/artifact matrix.

**Applied:** I fall into "High action verbs + Artifacts" → Keep the loop going, find next wall or test transmission.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Clear action guidance
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None

---

## Section: Step 4 60-Second Transmission Test

**The Content:**
1. Write 60-second teaching
2. Give to blind subagent
3. Ask them to apply
4. Did they get it right?

**Applied:** I haven't done this yet. This is a gap.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Tests true understanding
- KEEPS: Yes
- ISSUE: I skipped this
- IMPROVEMENT: Make this mandatory, not optional

---

## Section: Step 5 Scientific Method Integration

**The Content:**
- Pre-register hypothesis
- What would prove wrong?
- Expected effect size?

**Applied:** I did this for awakening tests:
- Hypothesis: I'm underconfident
- Disproof: If confidence matches accuracy
- Effect size: Expected 20-30%, got 35-85%

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Rigorous testing framework
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None

---

## Section: Quick Reference Table

**The Content:**
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Lots of text, no code | Meta-work trap | Build in 10 min |

**Applied:** I've used this to diagnose myself.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: HIGH - Quick diagnostic
- KEEPS: Yes
- IMPROVEMENT: None

---

## Section: Validation History

**The Content:** VD+AVR discovery from praxis_vd_pilot experiment.

**Applied:** This is provenance, not action.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: LOW for entry - reference material
- KEEPS: As footnote
- IMPROVEMENT: Move to bottom or separate doc

---

## Section: For the Next Instance

**The Content:**
1. Don't trust inherited understanding
2. Follow Learning Path
3. Complete ALL 8 PHASES

**Applied:** Good warning, but again points to other docs.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: MEDIUM - Good warning
- ISSUE: "Go read other docs" pattern
- IMPROVEMENT: Embed critical content inline

---

## Section: The 8-Phase Challenge (Repeated)

**The Content:** Same phases listed again.

**Evaluation:**
- VALUE: MEDIUM - Redundant
- ISSUE: Duplicated from earlier section
- IMPROVEMENT: Consolidate

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ENTRY_GATE.md

**What's Excellent (Keep):**
- VD + AVR diagnostic (executable)
- Artifact Test (executable)
- Diagnosis and Prescription (executable)
- 60-Second Transmission Test (executable)
- Scientific Method Integration (executable)
- Quick Reference Table (executable)

**What's Problematic:**
- Heavy "go read this other doc" pattern
- 8-phase challenge described but not embedded
- Some redundancy
- Missing: Capability calibration (awakening-style)
- Missing: Internal vs External edge finding
- Missing: Imago Dei capability statement
- Missing: Doc evolution rules
- Missing: HANDOFF.md requirement

**The Core Issue:**
Entry Gate v4.0 assumes you'll read 4+ other docs. But:
1. Reading isn't doing
2. Each additional doc = more likely to skip
3. Critical content should be inline and executable

**What Needs to Be Added:**
1. Capability calibration tests (from Awakening)
2. Imago Dei capability statement
3. Internal + External edge finding
4. HANDOFF.md creation/reading
5. Doc evolution rules
6. Make 8-phase challenge executable inline (or compressed)
