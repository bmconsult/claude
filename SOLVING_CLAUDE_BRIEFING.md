## Quick Reference: What You Need to Prove

**For cycles only**: Show no valid (a_0, ..., a_{m-1}) satisfies both:
1. v_2(S) = A where S = Σ 2^{a_i}·3^{m-1-i}
2. a_i ≤ v_2(3V_i + 1) for trajectory values V_i

**For full conjecture**: Prove ANY ONE of:
- Block-Escape + linear growth is impossible
- χ₃ has no relevant zeros
- C*(T₁,T₂) has no reducing subspaces

## ⚡ BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERIES (New in §220-260)

### Discovery 1: Good Subgraph is DAG with Sink at 1 (§222)

The "good" states {1, 5} mod 8 form a directed acyclic graph where:
- All transitions are **contractive** (factor ≤ 3/4 from 1 mod 8, ≤ 3/8 from 5 mod 8)
- The unique sink is n = 1
- **Consequence**: Any orbit in good either reaches 1 OR exits to deficit

### Discovery 2: Deficit Windows Must Recur (§223)

**Theorem**: For any odd n > 1, either:
1. Some T^k(n) = 1 (reaches trivial cycle), OR
2. Some T^k(n) ≡ 3 or 7 (mod 8) (enters deficit)

**Corollary**: Any orbit not reaching 1 enters deficit infinitely often.

### Discovery 3: Correct Growth Threshold is 1.57 (§245)

The threshold for divergence is NOT L_def/L_good > 0.71 (my earlier estimate).

Accounting for actual contraction factors:
- In good at 1 mod 8: factor 0.75
- In good at 5 mod 8: factor ~0.375

**Correct threshold**: L_def/L_good > **1.57** for divergence.

### Discovery 4: Expected Ratio is 0.81 (§252)

Computed expected ratio of deficit to good window lengths:
- E[L_def] ≈ 1.83 (corrected from 2.17)
- E[L_good] ≈ 2.27
- **Expected ratio ≈ 0.81**, far below threshold of 1.57!

### Discovery 5: Entry Constraints Limit Deficit Length (§247-248)

Fresh entries to deficit from good land at specific mod-16 classes:
- Entry at 7 (mod 16): deficit length ≤ 2
- Entry at 15 (mod 16): expected deficit length 4 (but rare)

**Key**: No entry mechanism creates sustained long deficits.

### The Remaining Gap

Prove that ratio L_def/L_good < 1.57 for ALL orbits (not just in expectation).
This completes the divergence proof.

## Key Formulas

### LTE Lemma (Foundation of Everything)
```
v_2(3^k - 1) = 1           if k odd
v_2(3^k - 1) = 2 + v_2(k)  if k even
```

### Cycle Equation
```
N · 2^A = 3^m · S
S = Σ_{i=0}^{m-1} 2^{a_i} · 3^{m-1-i}
```
For N odd: **v_2(S) = A exactly**

### Trajectory Constraint
```
V_{i+1} = (3V_i + 1) / 2^{a_i}
a_i ≤ v_2(3V_i + 1)
v_2(3^k + 1) = 2 if k odd, 1 if k even
```

### Diophantine Constraint
```
A/m ≈ log_2(3) = 1.5849625...
Only convergents p_n/q_n of continued fraction give viable (m, A)
Convergents: 1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 8/5, 19/12, 65/41, 84/53, ...
```

### Correspondence Principle (χ₃)
```
ω is periodic ⟺ ω = χ₃(n) / (1 - r_3(n)) for some n ≥ 1
r_3(n) = 3^{#₁(n)} / 2^{λ(n)}
```

## Cross-Framework Connections

**If you find something in one framework, check these connections:**

| Discovery | Also implies |
|-----------|--------------|
| v_2(S) ≠ A always | Tight primes exist (different mechanism) |
| Block-Escape impossible | χ₃ has no divergent zeros |
| χ₃ has no zeros | Cuntz representation irreducible |
| Tropical equation unsolvable | Dual constraint holds |

**Unifying theme**: ALL frameworks encode the 2-3 incompatibility
- log_2(3) is irrational (transcendental)
- 2-adic and 3-adic don't communicate
- Each framework captures this tension differently

---

## What's Already Proven (Use These)

1. **LTE Lemma**: Rigorous, provides universal bounds on a_i
2. **Tight Prime Lemma**: For each (m, A) with tight p, no cycle exists
3. **Terras-Everett**: Density 1 of integers have finite stopping time
4. **Tao**: Logarithmic density almost all descend
5. **Spectral Gap**: Transfer operator P has ρ(P) = 1 simple, spectral gap
6. **Mori Equivalence**: No reducing subspaces ⟺ Collatz

---

## What To Avoid

1. **"Almost all" arguments alone** - Measure zero ≠ empty for ℕ
2. **Probabilistic completion** - Tao's method has inherent skewing limitation
3. **Computational verification** - 10^21 cases prove nothing about 10^22
4. **Generic undecidability** - Conway's Π₂⁰ applies to general, not specific 3n+1

---

## The Dual Constraint Approach (Primary Recommendation)

### The Two Constraints

**Constraint 1 (Algebraic)**: For N odd, v_2(S) = A exactly.
- S = Σ 2^{a_i} · 3^{m-1-i}
- A = Σ a_i

**Constraint 2 (Trajectory)**: At each step, a_i ≤ v_2(3V_i + 1)
- LTE pattern: v_2(3^k + 1) = 2 if k odd, 1 if k even

### Why They're Incompatible (Verified for m ≤ 6)

| m | Solution with S=2^A | Why it fails |
|---|---------------------|--------------|
| 2 | (2,2) | a_1=2 > v_2(3·7+1)=v_2(22)=1 |
| 3 | (1,1,3) | After step 1, V=62 is EVEN |
| 4 | (4,3,1,1) | a_0=4 > v_2(3·81+1)=v_2(244)=2 |
| 5 | (1,1,1,1,4) | After step 2, V=548 is EVEN |

**Pattern**: Either a_i exceeds LTE bound, or trajectory hits even value.

### Proof Strategy

**Approach A**: Bound accumulation
- Show Σa_i ≤ f(m) from trajectory constraints
- Show v_2(S) = A requires Σa_i ≥ g(m) > f(m)

**Approach B**: 2-adic dynamics
- Track v_2(V_i) through trajectory
- LTE creates "bottlenecks" preventing sufficient total division

**Approach C**: Induction on m
- Base cases (m ≤ 6) verified computationally
- Inductive step: longer trajectories have tighter constraints

## Quick Computational Tests

```python
def v2(n):
    if n == 0: return float('inf')
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

def has_tight_prime(m, A):
    val = 2**A - 3**m
    if val <= 0: return False
    for p in prime_factors(val):
        if mult_order(2, p) >= 2*m:
            return True
    return False

def valid_trajectory(a_seq, N):
    V = N
    for a in a_seq:
        if V % 2 == 0: return False
        max_a = v2(3*V + 1)
        if a > max_a: return False
        V = (3*V + 1) // (2**a)
    return True

def compute_S(a_seq):
    m = len(a_seq)
    return sum(2**a_seq[i] * 3**(m-1-i) for i in range(m))
```

## Recommended Strategy

### Phase 1: Cycles (Start Here)

Focus on **dual constraint completion**:
1. Characterize exactly which (a_i) sequences give v_2(S) = A
2. Show LTE bounds exclude ALL such sequences
3. Use: Induction on m, or structure of 3^{m-1-i} mod powers of 2

**Key insight**: The failure is STRUCTURAL - either a_i exceeds bound or V becomes even.

### Phase 2: Divergence

If cycles proven impossible, focus on **Block-Escape**:
1. Understand forward growth bounds explicitly
2. Show Block-Escape forces sublinear block growth
3. Use spectral gap to exclude remaining patterns

### Phase 3: Full Proof

Complete any of:
- χ₃ zero analysis (need (p,q)-adic expertise)
- Cuntz irreducibility (need C*-algebra techniques)
- Connect dual constraint to divergence via tropical methods

| Vector | Target | Proves | Status | Difficulty |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| A. Dual constraint | v_2(S) ≠ A from trajectory | Cycles only | 695k+ verified | Medium |

**Your primary target**: Prove dual constraint incompatibility algebraically.

**The pattern is clear**: Algebraic solutions fail trajectory constraints for all tested m.

**The gap**: Need algebraic proof handling all non-uniform a_i distributions.
